Below is an example of a method named test_FileSystemProvider_isSameFile. This method checks if two file paths refer to the same file using the isSameFile method from the FileSystemProvider. This code will have to be integrated into Android activity or Java application and ensure to handle all the exceptions properly.

Please note that java.nio.file.spi.FileSystemProvider path is mostly used in Java SE, so it may not be applicable to Android as they have different file system APIs. You may need to use File class in Android.

```java
import java.io.IOException;
import java.nio.file.FileSystems;
import java.nio.file.Path;
import java.nio.file.spi.FileSystemProvider;


public void test_FileSystemProvider_isSameFile() {
     FileSystemProvider provider = FileSystems.getDefault().provider();
     
     Path path1 = provider.getPath("/path/to/file1");
     Path path2 = provider.getPath("/path/to/file2");
     
     try {
          boolean areSame = provider.isSameFile(path1, path2);
          if(areSame){
              System.out.println("Both paths point to the same file.");
          } else{
              System.out.println("The paths point to different files.");
          }
     } catch (IOException e) {
          // Properly handle IOException
          e.printStackTrace();
     }
}
```

This method first retrieves the default FileSystemProvider. After that, it uses this provider to create two Paths - path1 and path2. We then use the isSameFile method to check if the two paths refer to the same file. If they do, a message is printed to the console. If they do not, or if an IOException occurs (perhaps because one of the files does not exist), the exception is being caught and handled.

Keep in mind that you would need to replace the '/path/to/file1' and '/path/to/file2' with the actual paths of the files that you are checking.
