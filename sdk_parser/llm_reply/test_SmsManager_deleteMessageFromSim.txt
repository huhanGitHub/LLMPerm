Below is the example of a method using the `SmsManager.deleteMessageFromIcc` method. Please note that `deleteMessageFromIcc` is the official method according to the Android Documentation and not `deleteMessageFromSim`. 

```java
public void test_SmsManager_deleteMessageFromSim() {
    // Normally, you would get this from a list of all SMS messages on the SIM card
    int messageIndex = 0;
    SmsManager smsManager = SmsManager.getDefault();
    boolean isSuccess = smsManager.deleteMessageFromIcc(messageIndex);

    if (isSuccess) {
        Toast.makeText(getApplicationContext(), 
                       "Message deleted from SIM successfully", 
                       Toast.LENGTH_LONG).show();
    } else {
        Toast.makeText(getApplicationContext(), 
                       "Failed to delete the message from SIM", 
                       Toast.LENGTH_LONG).show();
    }
}
```

This method gets a default instance of SmsManager and tries to delete the message at index 0 on the SIM card using `deleteMessageFromIcc` function. If the operation is successful, a Toast message is shown indicating success, otherwise, it shows a failure message.

Keep in mind that this code should be run from an `Activity` or `Context` and the application needs to have permission to read SMS Messages.

Add the following line to your Android Manifest file to request the required permission:
```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_SMS"/>
```
