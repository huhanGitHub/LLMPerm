Here is a basic template for a method called test_Credential_getSimCredential. This code would hypothetically be added to an Android activity and would show the basic usage of the android.net.wifi.hotspot2.pps.Credential interface.

Please note the Credential.getSimCredential() is not a valid standard Android method which might be device/manufacturer-specific one or could be part of additional third-party libraries.

```java
import android.net.wifi.hotspot2.pps.Credential;
import android.net.wifi.hotspot2.pps.Credential.SimCredential;

public class MainActivity extends AppCompatActivity {

    //other code...

    public void test_Credential_getSimCredential() {
        Credential credential = getSomehowCredential(); //you need to get the Credential object somehow

        if (credential == null) {
            Log.d("MainActivity", "Credential is null");
            return;
        }

        try {
            SimCredential simCredential = credential.getSimCredential();
            if (simCredential != null) {
                String imsi = simCredential.getImsi();
                String eapType = simCredential.getEapType();
                //here some further operation with simCredential values...
                Log.d("MainActivity", "IMSI: " + imsi + ", EAP Type: " + eapType);
            } else {
                Log.d("MainActivity", "SimCredential is null");
            }
        } catch (Exception e) {
            Log.e("MainActivity", "Error getting SimCredential", e);
        }
    }

    private Credential getSomehowCredential() {
        // It's up to you to find out how to get the 'Credential' object in your specific context
        // This may involve calling methods on other objects, querying a database etc.
        return null;
    }
    
}
```
Please complete getSomehowCredential according to how you are going to get the Credential object in your specific context

Remember that this is a template and the actual code for getting a SimCredential may differ depending on your specific app context and the state of the Wi-Fi configuration.
