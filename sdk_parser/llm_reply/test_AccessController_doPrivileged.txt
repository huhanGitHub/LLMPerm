Here's an example of testing the `AccessController.doPrivileged()` method. This method provides a way of executing a code block with elevated permissions, useful when dealing with restricted operations like file access or Internet connectivity.

Note that the approach is generally used in java applications rather than Android. Android has its own permission model which is not exactly compatible with Java's `AccessController.doPrivileged()` usage.

```java
import java.security.AccessController;
import java.security.PrivilegedAction;
import java.io.File;

public class MainActivity extends AppCompatActivity {

    // ...

    public File test_AccessController_doPrivileged() {
        return AccessController.doPrivileged(
                new PrivilegedAction<File>() {
                    public File run() {
                        // privileges are asserted here
                        File file = new File("testfile.txt");
                        if (file.exists()) {
                            System.out.println("File exists");
                        } else {
                            System.out.println("File does not exist");
                        }
                        return file;
                    }
                }
        );
    }
}
```

This code executes a privileged action (reading a file) within the `doPrivileged` block. It will either print out "File exists" or "File does not exist", based on whether the file "testfile.txt" exists or not.

Remember that normal Android applications won't be able to use this approach due to the Android sandboxing features. This code is more appropriate for Java desktop applications or Java-based server applications. For Android, you would have to request permissions at runtime and add the required permissions to your AndroidManifest.xml file first.
