In order to use android.provider.SyncStateContract, you will need the READ_SYNC_STATS and WRITE_SYNC_SETTINGS permissions in your Android Manifest.xml file.

Here is an example of a method that updates a SyncStateContract:

```java
public void test_SyncStateContract_update() {
    //Get reference to ContentResolver
    ContentResolver contentResolver = getContentResolver();
    
    //Define Bundle for extras
    Bundle extras = new Bundle();
    
    try {
        //Get reference to Authority of ContentProvider
        String authority = "com.example.myapp.provider";
        
        //Get reference to Account
        Account account = new Account("test_account", "com.example.myapp");
        
        //Update sync settings
        //Enable sync for the account and authority
        ContentResolver.setSyncAutomatically(account, authority, true);
        
        //Set the frequency of sync to 1 hour
        ContentResolver.addPeriodicSync(account, authority, extras, 3600);
        
        Toast.makeText(getApplicationContext(), "Sync settings updated.", Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show();
    } catch (Exception e) {
        //Handle exception
        Toast.makeText(getApplicationContext(), "Error updating sync settings.", Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show();
    }
}
```

This method sets the sync settings for a specified account and authority, including enabling automatic syncing and setting the frequency of syncing. 

Before you can use this method, you will need to create a new account (in this case, "test_account") and a new authority (in this case, "com.example.myapp.provider"). You can create an account using the AccountManager system service, and you can create a new authority by creating a new ContentProvider.

Please replace "com.example.myapp" and "com.example.myapp.provider" with your own application's package name and authority, respectively. 

Remember, this code should be placed within an activity or some sort of event handler for it to be executed.
