Here is an example of how you could implement this method in an Android activity:

```java
import java.io.File;
import java.io.IOException;

public class MainActivity extends AppCompatActivity {
    @Override
    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);

        test_File_setReadable();
    }

    private void test_File_setReadable() {
        //Create a new file
        File file = new File(getFilesDir(), "test.txt");
        try {
            if (!file.exists()) {
                if (file.createNewFile()) {
                    System.out.println("The file has been created");
                } else {
                    System.out.println("The file already exists");
                }
            }
            //First parameter is to make the file readable, second one is whether only the owner can read it
            //Setting it to true means only the owner can read, setting it to false means everyone can read it
            if (file.setReadable(true, false)) {
                System.out.println("The file is now readable for everyone");
            } else {
                System.out.println("The operation failed");
            }
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```
In this example, the method `test_File_setReadable` is called inside the `onCreate` method in the activity. This method creates a new file named "test.txt" in the app's internal file directory. 

The `setReadable` method from `java.io.File` is then used to make the file readable. The first parameter passed to `setReadable` is `true` indicating that we are setting the file to be readable. The second parameter is `false` that means the readable permission is not restricted to the owner of the file only, i.e., the file can be read by any other users.

Please note that this is just an example and might not work in a real-world application. It is just to provide an understanding of using the `setReadable` method in Java/Android.
