Sure, here's an example of how one might use the `FileTypeDetector` abstract class in a method within an Android activity:

Note: The `FileTypeDetector` is an abstract class that needs to be subclassed to be used such as in this mocking manner.

```java
import java.io.IOException;
import java.nio.file.Path;
import java.nio.file.spi.FileTypeDetector;

public class MainActivity extends AppCompatActivity {

    private class MockFileTypeDetector extends FileTypeDetector {

        @Override
        public String probeContentType(Path path) throws IOException {
            // Implement your logic to determine the file type based on the Path.
            // For simplicity, this mock method says everything is "text/plain".
            return "text/plain";
        }
    }

    public void test_FileTypeDetector_probeContentType() {
        // Create a new MockFileTypeDetector
        MockFileTypeDetector mockFileTypeDetector = new MockFileTypeDetector();

        // Create a mock Path object (requires API level 26).
        Path fakePath = Paths.get("/path/to/file.txt");

        // Call probeContentType and store the result.
        String result = "";
        try {
            result = mockFileTypeDetector.probeContentType(fakePath);
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }

        // Print the result to the log.
        Log.d("FileTypeDetectorTest", "File type: " + result);
    }
}
```

In this mock method `probeContentType(Path path)`, it always returns the MIME type "text/plain", irrespective of the path provided. In a real-world usage scenario, you would implement your own logic to determine the file type based on the file path. 

The `test_FileTypeDetector_probeContentType()` method is just an example. It creates a `MockFileTypeDetector`, a mock `Path`, and then calls `probeContentType()` on the detector with the path as an argument. The resulting MIME type is then printed to the log.

However, note that Android java.nio.file API is not generally available until API Level 26 (Android 8.0â€”Oreo) for the usage with `Paths.get()`.
