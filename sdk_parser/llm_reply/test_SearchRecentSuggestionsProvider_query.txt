The `SearchRecentSuggestionsProvider` is an API that allows to add recent query suggestions functionality to a search feature. Below is a usage example for the `query` method.

Before we begin, please note that to use `SearchRecentSuggestionsProvider` you have to provide a unique authority string, along with an integer database version number, and then define your suggestion provider class using a `SearchRecentSuggestions` object.

Here is the creation of `SuggestionProvider` class:

```java
public class SuggestionProvider extends SearchRecentSuggestionsProvider {
    public final static String AUTHORITY = "com.example.SuggestionProvider";
    public final static int MODE = DATABASE_MODE_QUERIES;

    public SuggestionProvider() {
        setupSuggestions(AUTHORITY, MODE);
    }
}
```
You should add the following definition in your manifest file:

```xml
<provider 
    android:name="com.example.SuggestionProvider" 
    android:authorities="com.example.SuggestionProvider">
</provider>
```
Now let's move to your requested `test_SearchRecentSuggestionsProvider_query` method inside an activity:

```java
public void test_SearchRecentSuggestionsProvider_query() {
    // Initialize with the unique authority string 
    SearchRecentSuggestions suggestions = new SearchRecentSuggestions(this, 
        SuggestionProvider.AUTHORITY, SuggestionProvider.MODE);
    
    // Insert a suggestion into the database
    suggestions.saveRecentQuery("Android Guide", null);

    // Create a cursor and retrieve all the data
    Cursor cursor = suggestions.getQueryCursor("Android Guide", null);
    
    if (cursor.moveToFirst()){
        do{
            String query = cursor.getString(cursor.getColumnIndex(SearchManager.SUGGEST_COLUMN_TEXT_1));
            Log.d("SUGGESTION", query);
        } while (cursor.moveToNext());
    }
    
    // Do not forget to close the cursor
    cursor.close();
}
```

This will print out the recent query, in this case, "Android Guide" in the debug message.

Use this function for testing purposes. Be aware that in AndroidManifest the `SuggestionProvider` should have exported set to false for security reasons unless it's specifically designed to be shared with other apps.
