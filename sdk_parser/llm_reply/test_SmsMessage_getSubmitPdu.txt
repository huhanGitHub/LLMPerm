Below is a method that demonstrates how `getSubmitPdu` method from `SmsMessage` can be utilized in Android:

```java
public void test_SmsMessage_getSubmitPdu() {
    // Destination phone number
    String destinationAddress = "+1234567890";
    // SMS message body
    String message = "This is a test message";

    // Code to check if SMS service is available
    PackageManager pm = getPackageManager();
    boolean isSmsCapabilitySupported = pm.hasSystemFeature(PackageManager.FEATURE_TELEPHONY);

    if (isSmsCapabilitySupported) {
        // Check permissions
        if (ContextCompat.checkSelfPermission(this, Manifest.permission.SEND_SMS) != PackageManager.PERMISSION_GRANTED) {
            ActivityCompat.requestPermissions(this, new String[]{Manifest.permission.SEND_SMS}, SEND_SMS_PERMISSION_REQUEST_CODE);
        } else {
            // Create submitPdu
            SmsMessage.SubmitPdu pdu = SmsMessage.getSubmitPdu("00", destinationAddress, message, false);

            //Note that SMS sending functionality is blocked for safety reason
            //Use below code on your responsibility as it might incur SMS charges

            // Send the SMS
            //SmsManager smsManager = SmsManager.getDefault();
            //smsManager.sendRawPdu(pdu.encodedScAddress, pdu.encodedMessage);
    
            // printing for test
            if (pdu != null) {
                System.out.println("SC Address: " + new String(pdu.encodedScAddress));
                System.out.println("Message: " + new String(pdu.encodedMessage));
            } else {
                System.out.println("Unable to create SubmitPdu");
            }
        }
    } else {
        System.out.println("This device does not support SMS service.");
    }
}
```

This method initializes a destination phone number and an SMS message, then it checks if the device that's running the code supports telephony services. After that, it checks if the application has the 'SEND_SMS' permission granted. If all checks pass, it creates a SubmitPdu object with the provided data and prints it. Note that the actual sending of the SMS is commented out for safety reason to avoid unintended charges. Before uncommenting, make sure you understand that it could possibly incur SMS charges.
