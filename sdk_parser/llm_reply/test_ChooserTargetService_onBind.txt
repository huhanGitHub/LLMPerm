To create a usage example of the `ChooserTargetService`, there is a need to override `onBind()` method from the `ChooserTargetService` in an Android activity. This is due to the fact that `ChooserTargetService.onBind()` is a callback method that gets invoked by the Android system to bind an `IntentService` with your `Activity`. 

Unfortunately, the `ChooserTargetService` is not designed to test Android permissions. It's a service that's used to provide custom targets for the chooser dialog in Android, this allows you to customize the share UI that opens up when you call `startActivity(Intent.createChooser(yourIntent, "Share with"))`.

However, I can provide you a test method that verifies if binder is connected with `ChooserTargetService`. Please remember, for this code to work your activity needs to be bound by at least one `ChooserTargetService` instance.

```java
public void test_ChooserTargetService_onBind() {
    
    Intent intent = new Intent(this, ChooserTargetService.class);
    ServiceConnection connection = new ServiceConnection() {
        @Override
        public void onServiceConnected(ComponentName componentName, IBinder iBinder) {
            Log.d("Test", "Service successfully bound");
            assertNotNull(iBinder); // If iBinder is not null, it means Bind was successful.
        }

        @Override
        public void onServiceDisconnected(ComponentName componentName) {
            Log.d("Test", "Service disconnected");
        }
    };

    // Use bindService method
    boolean isBound = bindService(intent, connection, Context.BIND_AUTO_CREATE);
    if(isBound) {
        Log.d("Test", "Service is bound, now you can check onBind in your ChooserTargetService");
    } else {
        Log.d("Test", "Service not bound, check your ChooserTargetService onBind method.");
    }
}
```

This method, `test_ChooserTargetService_onBind()`, is creating a `ServiceConnection` and through calling `bindService` with the intent, we're checking whether it was successful in binding to the `ChooserTargetService` or not. However this is just a basic test without any details on what's happening inside `onBind` of your `ChooserTargetService`. 

The service itself would need to have been properly implemented with the `onBind` method returning valid `IBinder` for a successful connection. If not, then bindService would return false signaling unsuccessful bind.
