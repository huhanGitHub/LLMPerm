Sure, here is an example of a method that uses the transceive method from the NfcF class in Android:

Please note that this is a minimal example and depending on your specific requirements you might need to modify the code snippet. In addition, this example assumes you have necessary permissions to use NFC in your AndroidManifest.xml.

```java
import android.nfc.Tag;
import android.nfc.tech.NfcF;
import java.io.IOException;

public void test_NfcF_transceive(Activity activity, Tag tag) {
    NfcF nfcF = NfcF.get(tag);

    // Prepare command (example: get system code)
    byte[] command = new byte[]{(byte)0x00, (byte)0x00, (byte)0x0c, (byte)0x0f, (byte)0x00, (byte)0x00, (byte)0x0d};

    try {
        nfcF.connect();

        // Send command to tag and receive result
        byte[] response = nfcF.transceive(command);

        // Here, you would typically process the 'response' received from the tag...
    } catch (IOException e) {
        // Handle exception here
        e.printStackTrace();
    } finally {
        try {
            nfcF.close();
        } catch (IOException e) {
            // Handle exception here
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```
Remember to close the `nfcF` object using `nfcF.close()` once you're done to free up system resources. As usual for methods working with I/O, you also have to handle possible IOExceptions. In this example, they are just printed to stderr.

Also please add below NFC permissions and NFC feature declarations to your Android Manifest file:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.NFC" />

<uses-feature android:name="android.hardware.nfc" android:required="true" />
```
