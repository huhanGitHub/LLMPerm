Here's an example for a method that retrieves the CPU usage using the HardwarePropertiesManager in Android:

```java
@RequiresApi(api = Build.VERSION_CODES.N)
public void test_HardwarePropertiesManager_getCpuUsages() {
    // Get an instance of the HardwarePropertiesManager
    HardwarePropertiesManager hardwarePropertiesManager = (HardwarePropertiesManager) 
            getSystemService(Context.HARDWARE_PROPERTIES_SERVICE);

    try {
        // Use the HardwarePropertiesManager API to get the CPU's current usage
        float[] cpuUsages = hardwarePropertiesManager.getDeviceTemperatures(
                HardwarePropertiesManager.DEVICE_TEMPERATURE_CPU,
                HardwarePropertiesManager.TEMPERATURE_CURRENT);
        
        // Iterate over the CPU usages
        for (int i = 0; i < cpuUsages.length; i++) {
            // Print CPU usage
            Log.d("CPU_USAGE", "CPU #" + i + ": " + cpuUsages[i]);
        }
        
    } catch (Exception e) {
        // Log if something went wrong
        Log.e("HARDWARE_PROPERTIES_ERROR", "Getting CPU usage failed", e);
    }
}
```

Please remember that according to Android documentation, an app can only get the CPU temperature via the `HardwarePropertiesManager` class if the running Android device is running Android 7.0 (API level 24) or higher and if the app has the `Manifest.permission.DEVICE_POWER` permission.

Also, note that `getDeviceTemperatures()` does not return CPU usage but temperatures, because there are no official Android APIs to get CPU usage. However, you can get this data from files in the `/proc/` directory, but this approach is not recommended as these files are not part of Android's stable API and their format can vary between devices and Android versions.
