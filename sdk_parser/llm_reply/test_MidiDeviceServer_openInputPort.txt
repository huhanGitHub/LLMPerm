Here's a sample usage of the `openInputPort` method in the `MidiDeviceServer` class in Android. Please note that you need to handle the midi device connections in your code.

```java
import android.media.midi.MidiDeviceServer;
import android.media.midi.MidiReceiver;
import android.media.midi.MidiSender;
import android.os.Binder;
import android.os.IBinder;

public void test_MidiDeviceServer_openInputPort() {
    MidiDeviceServer.Callback callback = new MidiDeviceServer.Callback() {
        @Override
        public void onDeviceStatusChanged(MidiDeviceServer server, MidiDeviceStatus status) {
        }
    };

    MidiReceiver[] inputPortReceivers = new MidiReceiver[1];
    inputPortReceivers[0] = new MidiReceiver() {
        @Override
        public void onSend(byte[] msg, int offset, int count, long timestamp) throws IOException {
            // Process the received MIDI data here.
        }
    };

    MidiSender[] outputPortSenders = new MidiSender[1];
    outputPortSenders[0] = new MidiSender() {
    };

    IBinder token = new Binder();
    MidiDeviceServer server = new MidiDeviceServer(null, inputPortReceivers, outputPortSenders, callback, token);

    try {
        MidiReceiver receiver = server.openInputPort(0);
        // Use the receiver to send MIDI data here.
    } catch (IOException e) {
        e.printStackTrace();
    }
}
```

This code creates a `MidiDeviceServer` with a single input port and output port. It opens the input port and gets a `MidiReceiver` that can be used to send MIDI data to the device. Note that the `MidiDeviceServer` constructor used here is only available in Android 6.0 (API level 23) and higher. If your app needs to support lower API levels, you'll need to use a different method to create the `MidiDeviceServer`.

Also, this code is self-contained and does not handle the disconnection of the midi device. You should implement additional code to handle these cases according to your actual application requirements.
