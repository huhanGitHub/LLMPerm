* This is a usage example of how to use the joinGroup method from the MulticastSocket API.
*/
public void test_MulticastSocket_joinGroup() {
    MulticastSocket multicastSocket = null;
    InetAddress groupAddress = null;
    
    try {
        // Initialize MulticastSocket on port 1234
        multicastSocket = new MulticastSocket(1234);
        
        // Provide the IP address of the group you want to join
        groupAddress = InetAddress.getByName("230.0.0.1");
        
        // Join Group on given IP
        multicastSocket.joinGroup(groupAddress);
        
        Log.d("MulticastTest", "Successfully joined the multicast group");
        
        //code here to handle socket data
        
        // Always remember to leave the group when you are done
        multicastSocket.leaveGroup(groupAddress);
        Log.d("MulticastTest", "Successfully left the multicast group");
        
    } catch (IOException exception) {
        Log.e("MulticastTest", "Error occurred when joining or leaving a multicast group");
        exception.printStackTrace();
    } finally {
        if (multicastSocket != null) {
            multicastSocket.close();
        }
    }
}
```

In the above example, we are creating a `MulticastSocket` and attempting to join a multicast group using the `joinGroup` method. In case of an error, the exception will be caught and logged. Finally, we ensure to close the socket to avoid any memory leaks or other issues. 

Please note that you should replace "230.0.0.1" with the IP address of the multicast group you want to join or leave. Also keep in mind that Android requires the uses-permission `android.permission.CHANGE_WIFI_MULTICAST_STATE` to use MulticastSocket, therefore make sure to add `<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CHANGE_WIFI_MULTICAST_STATE" />` in your AndroidManifest.xml file. 

For the port number, replace "1234" with the port you need to listen on for multicast packets.
