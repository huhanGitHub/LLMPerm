The `SearchRecentSuggestions` class provides a method named `clearHistory` which is utilized to clear the search suggestions history. Below is a code snippet for the `test_SearchRecentSuggestions_clearHistory` method, which will be used to demonstrate the usage of `clearHistory` method.

The code will be used in an Android activity:

```java
import android.app.Activity;
import android.content.Context;
import android.provider.SearchRecentSuggestions;

public class TestActivity extends Activity {

    private final String AUTHORITY = "com.example.yourapplication";
    private final int MODE = 0;

    public void test_SearchRecentSuggestions_clearHistory() {
        SearchRecentSuggestions searchRecentSuggestions = new SearchRecentSuggestions(this, AUTHORITY, MODE);
        
        //Clearing the search suggestions history
        searchRecentSuggestions.clearHistory();
    }

    // Rest of your Activity code...
}
```
In this code snippet, note that you will need to replace `"com.example.yourapplication"` with your application's actual authority string. The `MODE` is usually set to `0` for private mode (this is the most common), although other modes exist. You can read more about these modes in the official Android documentation. 

After creating `SearchRecentSuggestions` instance with the authority and the mode, calling `clearHistory()` on this instance will clear all search input records from the suggestions history.
