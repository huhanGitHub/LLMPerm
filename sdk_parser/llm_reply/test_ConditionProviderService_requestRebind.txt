Here is a Java method `test_ConditionProviderService_requestRebind` that you can use as an example of using the `android.service.notification.ConditionProviderService` API, specifically its `requestRebind(ComponentName)` method:

```java
public void test_ConditionProviderService_requestRebind() {
    // Create a ComponentName for the ConditionProviderService you want to bind to
    // Replace "your.package.name" and "YourConditionProviderService"
    ComponentName serviceName = new ComponentName("your.package.name", "YourConditionProviderService");

    // Check if the app has the BROADCAST_SMS permission
    if (ContextCompat.checkSelfPermission(this, Manifest.permission.BROADCAST_SMS) == PackageManager.PERMISSION_GRANTED) {

        try {
            // Request to rebind to the ConditionProviderService
            ConditionProviderService.requestRebind(serviceName);
        } catch (Exception e) {
            // Log and handle the exception
            Log.e("ConditionProvider", "Failed to request rebind", e);
        }
        
    } else {

        // If the app does not have the permission, request it
        ActivityCompat.requestPermissions(this, new String[]{Manifest.permission.BROADCAST_SMS}, 1);
    }
}
```
Remember to replace `"your.package.name"` and `"YourConditionProviderService"` with the package name of your app and the class name of your `ConditionProviderService`, respectively.

This function first checks whether your app has the `BROADCAST_SMS` permission using `ContextCompat.checkSelfPermission()`, then it tries to rebind to the `ConditionProviderService` using `ConditionProviderService.requestRebind()`. 

Please note, the method `ConditionProviderService.requestRebind()` is a static request to rebind to the specified service, this could only be performed if the service had previously been enabled (refer to [Android ConditionProviderService Documentation](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/service/notification/ConditionProviderService#class_1)).
