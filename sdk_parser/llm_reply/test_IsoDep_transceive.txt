Here is an example of testing the transceive method in IsoDep class.

```Java
public void test_IsoDep_transceive() {
    try {
        // Create an NFC adapter instance
        NfcAdapter mAdapter = NfcAdapter.getDefaultAdapter(getApplicationContext());

        // Check if NFC is enabled on the device
        if (mAdapter.isEnabled()) {
            // Get the Intent that started this activity
            Intent intent = getIntent();

            // Get the Tag object from the Intent and create IsoDep instance
            Tag tagFromIntent = intent.getParcelableExtra(NfcAdapter.EXTRA_TAG);
            IsoDep isoDep = IsoDep.get(tagFromIntent);
        
            try {
                // Connect to the remote NFC device
                isoDep.connect();

                // Transceives data from one NFC device to another
                byte[] command = new byte[] { 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00 };
                byte[] response = isoDep.transceive(command);

                // Do something with the response
                // ...

            } catch (IOException e) {
                Log.e("IsoDep transceive", "IOExcetion: " + e.getMessage());
            } finally {
                if(isoDep.isConnected()) {
                    isoDep.close();
                }
            }
        } else {
            Toast.makeText(getApplicationContext(), "Please enable NFC and try again", Toast.LENGTH_LONG).show();
        }
    } catch (Exception e) {
        Log.e("IsoDep transceive", "Exception: " + e.getMessage());
    }
}
```

This method `test_IsoDep_transceive` is testing the `transceive` method of `IsoDep` class. It first checks if NFC is enabled on the device, and if it is, then it gets the `Tag` object from the Intent and creates an instance of `IsoDep`. Then it connects to the NFC device and sends a command to it. The NFC device then sends a response back. You can do a variety of things with this response. If there's an exception, it gets caught and logged. Finally, if `IsoDep` is still connected, it gets closed.
