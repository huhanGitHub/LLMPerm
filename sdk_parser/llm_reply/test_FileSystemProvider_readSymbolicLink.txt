Here's a stand-alone method, `test_FileSystemProvider_readSymbolicLink`, that you can add to any Android Activity to test the `FileSystemProvider.readSymbolicLink` method.

However, it is important to note that Android's `java.nio.file` package does not fully support symbolic links, so testing symbolic links may not work out of the box on Android like it would on a Java SE environment.

```java
import java.io.IOException;
import java.nio.file.*;
import java.nio.file.spi.FileSystemProvider;

public void test_FileSystemProvider_readSymbolicLink() {
    FileSystemProvider provider = FileSystems.getDefault().provider();

    // Let's assume that there is a symbolic link at /path/to/symbolicLink
    // which points to /path/to/target
    Path symbolicLink = Paths.get("/path/to/symbolicLink");

    try {
        Path target = provider.readSymbolicLink(symbolicLink);
        System.out.println("Symbolic link at " + symbolicLink.toString() +
            " points to " + target.toString());
    } catch (UnsupportedOperationException e) {
        // Handling symbolic links is not supported in Android's java.nio.file package
        e.printStackTrace();
    } catch (IllegalArgumentException e) {
        // The provided path does not correspond to a symbolic link
        e.printStackTrace();
    } catch (IOException e) {
        // An I/O error occurred
        e.printStackTrace();
    }
}
```

Please remember to adjust paths according to your needs and replace "/path/to/symbolicLink" and "/path/to/target" with your specific symbolicLink path and target path.

Also, don't forget to ask for the `READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` permission in your AndroidManifest.xml if you read a file outside of your application's scope:
```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE" />
```
This method should run without throwing any errors if there is a symbolic link at "/path/to/symbolicLink" and if your app has the required permissions. However, in Android the test will most likely fail as the android file system doesn't really support symbolic links.
