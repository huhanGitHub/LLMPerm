The method `Files.probeContentType(Path path)` is used to detect a file's MIME type or content type. Please note that the Files API is a part of the Java NIO package and doesn't necessarily work on all Android versions because Android doesn't fully support Java NIO.

Let's detect the MIME type of a local file on your device:

```java
import java.nio.file.Path;
import java.nio.file.Paths;
import java.nio.file.Files;
import java.io.IOException;

public class MainActivity extends AppCompatActivity {
    
    // ...
    
    public String test_Files_probeContentType() {
        String mimeType = "";
        try {
            // Set the path of the file
            Path path = Paths.get("/path/to/your/file");

            // Use Files.probeContentType(Path) to get the file's MIME type
            mimeType = Files.probeContentType(path);
            
            // Log or return the MIME type
            Log.i("MIME Type", "The detected MIME type is: " + mimeType);
        } catch (IOException e) {
            // Error handling, e.g. Log to console
            Log.e("MIME Type", "Error probing MIME type", e);
        }
        
        return mimeType;
    }
    
    // ...
}
```
Here, `"/path/to/your/file"` should be replaced with the full local path to your actual file. The `IOException` can be thrown if an I/O error occurs, meaning that there could be an issue with accessing the file. You should call the `test_Files_probeContentType()` method to check the content type of the file.

Although this code will work in a full Java environment, it will not work in an Android app. Android does not support full Java NIO, which includes `java.nio.file.Files` class, until Android 8 (Oreo, API level 26). If you're targeting earlier Android versions, you'll need to use different APIs to accomplish the same task.
