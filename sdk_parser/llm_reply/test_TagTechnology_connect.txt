Below is an example of a unit test for the connect() method of a TagTechnology object in an Android project. This method is a part of the Near Field Communication (NFC) API in Android. 

We are assuming that you want a method that will work in a real application scenario and not a unit test for testing purposes, since testing Android specific classes can be quite complex and involves using a testing framework like Espresso or Robotium.

Given below is a simple way of using the connect() method in a real environment:

```java
import android.nfc.Tag;
import android.nfc.tech.NfcA;
import android.nfc.tech.TagTechnology;

public void test_TagTechnology_connect() {
    try {
        Tag tag = ...; //we must fetch the tag, usually it is from an Intent in the onNewIntent method of your Activity
        if (tag != null){
            TagTechnology tagTech = NfcA.get(tag);
            if(!tagTech.isConnected()){
                tagTech.connect();
            } //You are now connected to the tag and can perform I/O operations
            //End your work by closing the connection
            if (tagTech.isConnected()) {
                tagTech.close();
            }
        }
    }catch (IOException ioe){
        Log.e("TAG", ioe.getMessage());
        //Handle IOException. This exception is thrown when I/O operation failed or your phone does not support NFC
    }
}
```
In the code snippet above, we are:
- Fetching a Tag object; in a real application this would typically be passed in an Intent to an NFC-enabled activity (this happens when the phone is put close to an NFC tag).
- Creating a TagTechnology (we've used NfcA here, but it could be any other technology).
- Making a connection to the tag.
- And finally, closing the connection. 

Please note, for this code to work you need to declare the necessary NFC permissions in your AndroidManifest.xml file:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.NFC" />
<uses-feature android:name="android.hardware.nfc" android:required="true" />
```
