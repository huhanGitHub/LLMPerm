Here is a self-contained example method called `test_Files_getAttribute`. This uses the `java.nio.file.Files` API from Java and it tests getting a file's last modification time attribute.

Due to Android's restricted access to certain files and directories, it would be wise to use this within the directory returned by `context.getFilesDir()` in Android environments or a directory where you have certain read-write access.

Please note that `java.nio.file` is supported from Android API level 26+.

```java
import java.nio.file.Files;
import java.nio.file.Path;
import java.nio.file.Paths;
import java.nio.file.attribute.FileTime;
import android.util.Log;

public class MainActivity extends AppCompatActivity {

    // Other code goes here

    public void test_Files_getAttribute() {
        try {
            // Create a Path instance from file path
            Path filePath = Paths.get(getFilesDir().getAbsolutePath() + "/testfile.txt"); // use your file path

            // Use Files.getAttribute to get last modification time
            FileTime lastModifiedTime = (FileTime) Files.getAttribute(filePath, "lastModifiedTime");

            // Log the output
            Log.d("File Attribute", "Last modified time: " + lastModifiedTime.toString());
        } catch (Exception e) {
            // Handle the exception
            Log.e("Error", "Error occurred while getting attribute: " + e.getMessage());
        }
    }
}
```

This `test_Files_getAttribute` method will attempt to fetch the last modification time of the specified file within the application's internal storage, and log the output. 

However, you must remember to replace "testfile.txt" with the name of an actual file present on your application's internal storage or a path you have access to. It would be a good practice to first check if the file actually exists or not before trying to access its attributes.
