The following is an example of a method that uses the `SliceManager` class in Android to check slice permissions. It's important to note that slice permissions and accessing them are a part of newer Android APIs (API level 28 and above).

Make sure to handle the necessary permissions in the AndroidManifest.xml file. The instructions to do so can be found in Android official documentation. 

This method uses try/catch to prevent the app from crashing if the slice is not available.

```java
// Imports needed for this method
import android.app.slice.SliceManager;
import android.content.Context;
import android.net.Uri;
import android.os.Build;
import androidx.annotation.RequiresApi;

public void test_SliceManager_enforceSlicePermission() {
    // Replace with your specific slice URI
    Uri myUri = Uri.parse("content://com.example.app/myslice");

    // You need to obtain a reference to the SliceManager
    if (Build.VERSION.SDK_INT >= Build.VERSION_CODES.P) {
        SliceManager sliceManager = (SliceManager) getSystemService(Context.SLICE_SERVICE);

        // Check if the Slice permissions have been granted
        try {
            sliceManager.enforceSlicePermission(myUri, getPackageName());
            // If no SecurityException is thrown, permission is granted
            System.out.println("Slice permission is granted.");
        } catch (SecurityException e) {
            // Catch an exception if the permission is not granted
            System.out.println("Slice permission is NOT granted. " + e.getMessage());
        }
    }
}
```

Remember to replace `"content://com.example.app/myslice"` with the actual URI for your slice. You can also replace `getPackageName()` with the actual package name of the app that needs the permission. You should have slice permissions defined in your app manifest file before using this method.
