Here is a simple method example called `test_File_canRead`, which uses the `canRead` method from the `File` class in Java. 

```java
public boolean test_File_canRead(String filePath) {
    // create new file object
    File file = new File(filePath);

    // tests whether the application can read the file  
    boolean canRead = file.canRead();

    if(canRead) {
        System.out.println("The file is accessible for read operation");
    } else {
        System.out.println("The file is not accessible for read operation");
    }
  
    return canRead;
}
```

What this method does is it takes a file path as input. It creates a new `File` object for the given file path. Then it checks whether that particular file can be read or not, printing a message in each case. The result is returned as a boolean value.
