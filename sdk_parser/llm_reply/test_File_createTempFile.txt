Here is a method `test_File_createTempFile()` that provides an example usage of the `File.createTempFile()` method in Java. This method is used to make a temporary file with given prefix and suffix.

In this method, we use a try-catch block to catch the `IOException` that can be potentially thrown by the `createTempFile()` method. We then print out the details of the created temporary file.

Please note that you should automatically get permission to write to the filesystem on Android. Otherwise, the `FileNotFoundException` may occur.

```java
public void test_File_createTempFile() {
    try {
        // Create a temporary file with "test" as prefix and ".txt" as suffix
        File tempFile = File.createTempFile("test", ".txt");

        // Check if the file is created successfully
        if(tempFile.exists()) {
            System.out.println("Temp file was created at path: " + tempFile.getAbsolutePath());
        } else {
            System.out.println("Failed to create temp file.");
        }

        // Always remember to delete the file when it's no longer needed
        boolean deleted = tempFile.delete();
        if (deleted){
            System.out.println("Temp file was deleted.");
        } else {
            System.out.println("Failed to delete temp file.");
        }

    } catch (IOException e) {
        // Failed to create temporary file, print the stack trace
        e.printStackTrace();
    }
}
```
This will create the temporary file in the default system temporary-file directory. If you want to specify a directory, you can use the `File.createTempFile(String prefix, String suffix, File directory)` method instead.
