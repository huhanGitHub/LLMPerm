Here's a method that demonstrates the usage of AtomicFile in renaming a file:

```Java
import android.util.AtomicFile;
import java.io.File;
import java.io.FileOutputStream;
import java.io.IOException;

public class MainActivity extends AppCompatActivity {

     //...

    public void test_AtomicFile_rename() {
        AtomicFile atomicFile = null;
        FileOutputStream fileOutputStream = null;

        try {
            File oldFile = new File(getFilesDir(), "oldFileName.txt");
            atomicFile = new AtomicFile(oldFile);
            fileOutputStream = atomicFile.startWrite();

            File newFile = new File(getFilesDir(), "newFileName.txt");
            boolean isRenamed = oldFile.renameTo(newFile);

            if(!isRenamed){
                throw new IOException("Failed to rename file");
            }
            atomicFile.finishWrite(fileOutputStream);
            Log.d("Test", "Successfully renamed. AtomicFile is used.");

        } catch (IOException e) {
            Log.e("Test", "Failed to use AtomicFile", e);  
            if(atomicFile != null){
               atomicFile.failWrite(fileOutputStream);
            }
        } finally {
            if(fileOutputStream != null){
                try { fileOutputStream.close(); } catch (IOException e) { e.printStackTrace(); }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

The `test_AtomicFile_rename` method uses an `AtomicFile` to handle a file rename operation. `AtomicFile` is part of Android's internal APIs and is used to perform atomic operations on a file. Atomic operations are operations that either fully complete or don't happen at all, ensuring data consistency.

In the code above, we're attempting to rename a file `oldFileName.txt` to `newFileName.txt`. If the rename operation fails for any reason (the IOException caught in the try/catch block), `AtomicFile` ensures that the original file is as it was before the operation began using `failWrite()`. If the rename operation is successful, we commit the changes with `finishWrite(FileOutputStream stream)`.
