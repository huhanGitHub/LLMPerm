Here's an example of a method that you may use to test the `getRequiredPermission` method which is part of the `Sensor` class in Android.

In this case, we are writing an example when `getRequiredPermission` is not directly a method in Android's Sensor class but it can be useful if the sensor needs some specific permissions. Let's assume this.

```java
@RequiresApi(api = Build.VERSION_CODES.JELLY_BEAN_MR2)
public void test_Sensor_getRequiredPermission() {
    // Get the Sensor Service from the System Service
    SensorManager sensorManager = (SensorManager) getSystemService(Context.SENSOR_SERVICE);

    if (sensorManager != null) {
        // Get the first available Sensor
        Sensor sensor = sensorManager.getSensorList(Sensor.TYPE_ALL).get(0);
        
        // Let's assume that our Sensor has a getRequiredPermission method
        String requiredPermission = getRequiredPermission(sensor);

        if (requiredPermission != null) {
            Log.i("SensorPermission", "The sensor requires following permission: " + requiredPermission);
            PackageManager pm = getPackageManager();
            int hasPerm = pm.checkPermission(
                requiredPermission,
                getPackageName()
            );
            if (hasPerm != PackageManager.PERMISSION_GRANTED) {
                Log.i("SensorPermission", 
                   "The required permission is not granted. Please check your app permissions.");
            } else {
                Log.i("SensorPermission", "The required permission is granted.");
            }
        } else {
            Log.i("SensorPermission", "The sensor does not require any specific permissions.");
        }
    }
}

/**
 * Let's assume that our Sensor class has a getRequiredPermission method
 */
private String getRequiredPermission(Sensor sensor) {
    // We just return null for simplicity. You should replace this with actual code.
    return null;
}
```
This sample method gets an instance of a `SensorManager`, then retrieves the first available `Sensor` from the system. It then checks if the sensor requires any specific permission by calling our fictitious `getRequiredPermission(sensor)` method, and logs the result.

Please note that the `getRequiredPermission` method is not actually a part of Android's `Sensor` class as it does not require any specific permissions to function. The permissions required to access sensor data are generally declared in the app's manifest file rather than in the `Sensor` class itself. 

So in real use cases the permission depends on the `Sensor` type, for using `SENSOR_SERVICE` you need `android.permission.BODY_SENSORS` permission or for using camera sensor you will need `android.permission.CAMERA` permission. Always refer to the official Android Developers' Documentation when dealing with such permissions.
