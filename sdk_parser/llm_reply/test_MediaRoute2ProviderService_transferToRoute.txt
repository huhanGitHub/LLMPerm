Android doesn't provide direct API to make usage of transferToRoute method from the MediaRoute2ProviderService class. This is an abstract system-level method that services use internally to perform route transfers.

MediaRouter2ProviderService isn't supposed to be used directly in an Activity. Instead, the system uses it to manage media routing for your app. The MediaRoute2Provider concept is normally used to handle custom routes for media redirection, such as external speakers, remote devices, etc, which is handled on system level.

However, here's a piece of pseudo code, which would mimic, how such a method might look like based on generic Java/Android patterns. This is not tested or working code, rather a hypothetical usage.

```java
public void test_MediaRoute2ProviderService_transferToRoute() {
    final String oldRouteId = "oldRouteId";
    final String newRouteId = "newRouteId";
    
    // NOTE: This code should not be used in actual application. This is only an attempt to illustrate how the method usage would look like if it was accessible directly.
    MediaRoute2ProviderService mediaRoute2ProviderService = new MediaRoute2ProviderService() {
        @Override
        public void onTransferToRoute(String oldRouteId, String newRouteId) {
            super.onTransferToRoute(oldRouteId, newRouteId);
            // potentially some implementation logic...
        }

        @Nullable
        @Override
        public RouteDiscoveryPreference onGetRouteDiscoveryPreference() {
            return null;
        }

        @Nullable
        @Override
        public List<MediaRoute2Info> onGetRoutes() {
            return null;
        }
    };

    // Trying to mimic transfer
    mediaRoute2ProviderService.onTransferToRoute(oldRouteId, newRouteId);
}
```

Please note it again, this piece of code won't compile in usual Android projects because the MediaRoute2ProviderService class is not designed to be used in this way.

You would need to implement a MediaRoute2Provider to use MediaRouter, which involves much more than just calling one method. Review the Android developer guide on creating a media router provider for more details: https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/media/mediarouter#java
