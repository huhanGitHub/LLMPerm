The java.util.prefs.Preferences API is not available in Android. The java.util.prefs package provides a way to store preference data, but it's designed to fit the standard Java SE environment and it's not included in the Android's SDK. Android has its own way of dealing with preferences through SharedPreferences.

However, here's what it would look like if it was available:

```java
import java.util.prefs.Preferences;

public void test_Preferences_importPreferences() {
    try {
        FileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream(new File("<xml_file>"));
        Preferences.importPreferences(fis);
    } catch (Exception e) {
        e.printStackTrace();
    }
}
```

Replace "<xml_file>" with the full path of your .xml file that contains the preferences to import.

Please note, this is a method that should be part of a class and it's a standard java method. This method cannot be used in an Android Activity because java.util.prefs.Preferences is not a part of Android SDK.

For Android, SharedPreferences are used to store simple application data. Here's an Android example:

```java
import android.content.SharedPreferences;
import android.preference.PreferenceManager;

public void importPreferences() {
    SharedPreferences preferences = PreferenceManager.getDefaultSharedPreferences(this);

    String existingPreference = preferences.getString("existingPreference", "default");
    System.out.println("Existing Preference - " + existingPreference);
}
```

In this example, the PreferenceManager class is used to retrieve the default shared preferences object for the entire application. Then, a key is used to retrieve a stored preference, in this case "existingPreference". If no value is found for this key, "default" is returned.
