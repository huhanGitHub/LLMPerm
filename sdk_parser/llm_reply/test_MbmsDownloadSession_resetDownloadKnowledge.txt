Here is the example method using the API `MbmsDownloadSession.resetDownloadKnowledge()` :

```java
public void test_MbmsDownloadSession_resetDownloadKnowledge() {
    // Initialize a context, here we use `this` as activity itself act as a Context.
    Context context = this;

    // Initialize an instance of `MbmsDownloadSession` through `create` method.
    MbmsDownloadSession downloadSession = MbmsDownloadSession.create(context, new HandlerExecutor(new Handler(Looper.myLooper())), null /* callback */);
    try {
        // Call `resetDownloadKnowledge` method, for now we're assuming it is going to be executed in main thread.
        downloadSession.resetDownloadKnowledge(serviceId);

    } catch (RuntimeException re) {
        // Handle the potential runtime exception being thrown.
        Log.e(TAG, "Exception thrown in test_MbmsDownloadSession_resetDownloadKnowledge: ", re);
    } catch (IOException ie) {
        // Handle the potential IO exception being thrown.
        Log.e(TAG, "Exception thrown in test_MbmsDownloadSession_resetDownloadKnowledge: ", ie);
    } finally {
        // Always close the `MbmsDownloadSession` when you're done with it.
        downloadSession.close();
    }
}
```
Please note it's assuming this method is executed in a thread with `Looper` attached and the `serviceId` string reason is not provided. Make sure to replace `TAG` with the appropriate LOG_TAG and handle exceptions as needed.
