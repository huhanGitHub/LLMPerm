Sure, here's a simple usage of the Ringtone class in android.media package.

```java
import android.media.Ringtone;
import android.media.RingtoneManager;
import android.net.Uri;
import android.content.Context;

public void test_Ringtone_playFallbackRingtone() {
    try {
        // Obtain a Uri for our fallback ringtone
        Uri notification = RingtoneManager.getDefaultUri(RingtoneManager.TYPE_NOTIFICATION);
        // If the user has a different preference, attempt to obtain that
        if (notification == null) {
            notification = RingtoneManager.getDefaultUri(RingtoneManager.TYPE_RINGTONE);
        }

        // If we've correctly obtained a Uri, try to play it as a fallback
        if (notification != null) {
            Ringtone r = RingtoneManager.getRingtone(getApplicationContext(), notification);
            r.play();
        }
    } catch (Exception e) {
        e.printStackTrace();
    }
}
```
This method fetches the user's default notification sound and attempts to play it as a fallback if the original ringtone isn't available. If a notification sound isn't set, it attempts to fetch the user's default ringtone instead. It then creates a Ringtone object out of the obtained Uri and calls its `play` method to play it.

This API will require the `android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` permission if the URI points to data that is not owned by the calling application, the `android.permission.WRITE_SETTINGS` if the ringtone type is TYPE_RINGTONE and the application is not system or the default ringtone provider, or `android.permission.ACCESS_NOTIFICATION_POLICY` if the ringtone is being used for a notification policy.

Please remember to make sure you have the right permissions to access and play the ringtones.
