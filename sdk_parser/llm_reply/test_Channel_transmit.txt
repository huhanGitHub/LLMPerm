Below is an example of a Java method in an Android Activity that uses android.se.omapi.Channel's transmit method. It assumes that the Channel object is available and that the application already has the necessary permissions.

``` java
import android.se.omapi.Channel;
import android.util.Log;
import java.io.IOException;

public class MainActivity extends AppCompatActivity {
    // You would usually get your Channel instance through a Reader
    private Channel channel;

    public void test_Channel_transmit() {
        if (channel != null) {
            byte[] command = new byte[] { (byte) 0x00, (byte) 0x84, (byte) 0x00, (byte) 0x00, (byte) 0x08 };
            try {
                byte[] response = channel.transmit(command);
                if (response != null) {
                    Log.d("Test Channel", "Transmit success. Response: " + new String(response));
                } else {
                    Log.d("Test Channel", "Response is null.");
                }
            } catch (IOException e) {
                Log.e("Test Channel", "Error in transmit: " + e.getMessage());
            } catch (SecurityException e) {
                Log.e("Test Channel", "Missing required permissions.");
            }
        } else {
            Log.e("Test Channel", "Channel is null.");
        }
    }
}
```

This simulation command (0x0084000008) will generate a random number each time you execute it. The `transmit()` method sends this command to the card and returns the response. 

Please note it's only example, in real application you should close channels when you're done with them. Also try-catch is necessary since exceptions can be thrown if there's an IO error or if the necessary permissions haven't been granted. 

The android application should have the permission `com.android.permission.BIND_DEVICE_ADMIN` to access Open Mobile API (android.se.omapi).
