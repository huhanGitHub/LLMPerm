Sure, here is an example of how you might use the DnsResolver.query API in a test method. This code could be used inside an Android activity. Please note that DnsResolver class was added in Android API level 29 (Android 10.0).

```java
@RequiresApi(api = Build.VERSION_CODES.Q)
public void test_DnsResolver_query(Context context){

    DnsResolver resolver = DnsResolver.getInstance();
    Network network = ((ConnectivityManager)context.getSystemService(Context.CONNECTIVITY_SERVICE)).getActiveNetwork();
    byte[] query = DnsPacket.buildAQuery("www.example.com", (short) 0);

    try {
        CancellationSignal cancellationSignal = new CancellationSignal();
        resolver.query(network, query, cancellationSignal, new DnsResolver.Callback<byte[]>() {
            @Override
            public void onAnswer(@Nullable byte[] answer, int rcode) {
                // onAnswer() gets called when a DNS answer is available.
                // rcode is the DNS RCODE value or -1 if the answer is incomplete or malformed
                // answer is byte representation of the full DNS name service record set
            }

            @Override
            public void onError(@NotNull DnsResolver.DnsException error) {
                // onError() gets called when there was any error in getting answer.
                // error is the type of error occurred while retrieving DNS details.
            }
        });
        // Use cancellationSignal if needed to cancel and stop onAnswer(), onError() from being called
        // cancellationSignal.cancel();

    }catch (ErrnoException errnoException){
        // Handle exception here
        errnoException.printStackTrace();
    }
}
```
Then you can call this function within your activity as per your need.
