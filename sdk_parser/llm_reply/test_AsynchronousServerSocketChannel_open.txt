Here's an example of a method, `test_AsynchronousServerSocketChannel_open`, which demonstrates the usage of AsynchronousServerSocketChannel's open method. As AsynchronousServerSocketChannel is part of the Java's NIO package and has nothing to do with Android permissions, the following method can be ran on an Android device, but doesn't test any Android specific feature:

```java
public void test_AsynchronousServerSocketChannel_open() {
    final int port = 8000; // You can choose the port number

    // We are creating a Runnable task to run the server because
    // network operations should not run on the UI thread in Android.
    Runnable serverTask = new Runnable() {
        @Override
        public void run() {
            try {
                // Open an AsynchronousServerSocketChannel
                AsynchronousServerSocketChannel serverChannel = AsynchronousServerSocketChannel.open();

                // Bind the serverChannel to local address
                serverChannel.bind(new InetSocketAddress(port));
                System.out.println("Server is listening at " + port);

                // Accept a connection
                serverChannel.accept(null, new CompletionHandler<AsynchronousSocketChannel, Object>() {
                    @Override
                    public void completed(AsynchronousSocketChannel result, Object attachment) {
                        System.out.println("Connection accepted");
                        // Close the server channel
                        try {
                            serverChannel.close();
                        } catch (IOException e) {
                            System.err.println("Failed to close server channel: " + e);
                        }
                    }

                    @Override
                    public void failed(Throwable exc, Object attachment) {
                        System.err.println("Failed to accept a connection: " + exc);
                    }
                });

                // Let the server run for 10 seconds
                Thread.sleep(10000);

            } catch (IOException | InterruptedException e) {
                System.err.println("Server failed: " + e);
            }
        }
    };

    // Start the server in a new thread
    Thread serverThread = new Thread(serverTask);
    serverThread.start();
}
```

In addition, this method creates a server that listens on a port for 10 seconds. Please note that in order to execute socket operations, your Android device should have proper security permissions added in the Android Manifest:

```
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```
