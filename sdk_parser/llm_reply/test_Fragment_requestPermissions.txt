Here is an example of a method that uses the `requestPermissions` method from the `Fragment` class in Android:

```java
public void test_Fragment_requestPermissions() {
    Fragment fragment = new Fragment() {
        @Override
        public void onRequestPermissionsResult(int requestCode, @NonNull String[] permissions, @NonNull int[] grantResults) {
            super.onRequestPermissionsResult(requestCode, permissions, grantResults);

            // Check if the only required permission has been granted
            if (grantResults.length == 1 && grantResults[0] == PackageManager.PERMISSION_GRANTED) {
                Toast.makeText(getActivity(), "Permission granted!", Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show();
            } else {
                Toast.makeText(getActivity(), "Permission not granted.", Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show();
            }
        }
    };

    String permission = Manifest.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE;
    if (ContextCompat.checkSelfPermission(this, permission)
            != PackageManager.PERMISSION_GRANTED) {
        
        // Should show an explanation for the user
        if (fragment.shouldShowRequestPermissionRationale(permission)) {
            // Show an explanation to the user asynchronously
            Toast.makeText(this, "We need your permission to read external storage.", Toast.LENGTH_LONG).show();
        }
        
        fragment.requestPermissions(new String[] {permission}, 0);
    } else {
        Toast.makeText(this, "Permission already granted.", Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show();
    }
}
```

In this method, we created an anonymous `Fragment` instance and overrode its `onRequestPermissionsResult` method, which will be called when the user responds to the permission request. The `requestCode` you set in `requestPermissions()` will be delivered here.

Note that if the app already has the permission, it will display a toast saying that the permission is already granted. If it doesn't and the app has requested this permission previously but the user denied the request, it should show a rationale to the user. Then the permission is requested with `requestPermissions()`.

Don't forget to add the permission to the manifest file.
```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE" />
```
