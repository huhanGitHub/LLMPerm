The MmsManager API is not publicly available or directly accessible in standard Android SDK. However, below I provide a simulated code snippet that shows how such a scenario might be managed if such an API existed.

```java
import android.net.Uri;
import android.telephony.MmsManager;
//...

public void test_MmsManager_downloadMultimediaMessage() {
    //Considering MmsManager as a hypothetical class
    //We proceed assuming this class provides us with methods to handle MMS features
    
    try {
        MmsManager mmsManager = MmsManager.getInstance(); //Assuming singleton pattern
        Uri mmsUri = Uri.parse("content://mms-sms/conversations/"); //Get Uri of MMS
        
        //Suppose downloadMultimediaMessage returns boolean value indicating success or failure
        boolean isDownloaded = mmsManager.downloadMultimediaMessage(this, mmsUri);

        if (isDownloaded) {
            System.out.println("MMS downloaded successfully.");
        } else {
            System.out.println("MMS download failed.");
        }
    } catch (Exception e) {
        e.printStackTrace();
    }
}
```

In this example, we're assuming that the MmsManager provides a static getInstance method to obtain an instance of the class. We're also using a URI which represents a hypothetical path to an MMS message.

Please note that in the current Android SDK, you can't directly access and manage MMS messages in this way - the system handles things like MMS for you. Changes to this may have occurred in a custom ROM, but that won't apply to all devices or systems.
