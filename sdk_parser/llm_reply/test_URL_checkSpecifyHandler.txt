```java
private void test_URL_checkSpecifyHandler() {
    // Define the URL string
    String urlString = "https://www.example.com";

    try {
        // Specify a default URLStreamHandler by creating anonymous class
        URLStreamHandler handler = new URLStreamHandler() {
            @Override
            protected URLConnection openConnection(URL url) throws IOException {
                // Insert your custom connection settings here
                return url.openConnection(Proxy.NO_PROXY); 
            }
        };

        // Create URL object using URL string and custom URLStreamHandler
        URL url = new URL(null, urlString, handler);

        // Use URL object as needed
        URLConnection connection = url.openConnection();
        // ...
    } catch (MalformedURLException e) {
        // Handle malformed URL
        e.printStackTrace();
    } catch (IOException e) {
        // Handle IO error
        e.printStackTrace();
    }
}
```
The above code defines a method called `test_URL_checkSpecifyHandler` in which a string URL is defined. A `URLStreamHandler` is set up to handle the specified URL. This stream handler is then used to create a URL object. An `openConnection` method of the `URL` class is then used to open a connection to this web address. The returned `URLConnection` object can be used to further interact with the server.

It is worth noting that the `URL` class and the `URLStreamHandler` class are both part of the `java.net` package in Java. The `URL` class can be used to represent a Uniform Resource Locator, a pointer to a "resource" on the World Wide Web. A resource can be something as simple as a file or a directory, or it can be a reference to a more complicated object, such as a query to a database or to a search engine.
