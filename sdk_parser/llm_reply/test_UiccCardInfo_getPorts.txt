Based on the current Android documentation, the class android.telephony.UiccCardInfo does not have a getPorts() method, hence it is not possible to provide an example of a method that uses "getPorts()" from this class. However, I can provide an example of usage of the "UiccCardInfo" class.

```java
public void test_UiccCardInfo() {
    if (android.os.Build.VERSION.SDK_INT >= android.os.Build.VERSION_CODES.R) {
        TelephonyManager telephonyManager = (TelephonyManager) getSystemService(Context.TELEPHONY_SERVICE);

        List<UiccCardInfo> uiccCardInfos = telephonyManager.getUiccCardsInfo();
        if (uiccCardInfos != null && !uiccCardInfos.isEmpty()) {
            for (UiccCardInfo uiccCardInfo : uiccCardInfos) {
                String cardId = uiccCardInfo.getCardId();
                int slotIndex = uiccCardInfo.getSlotIndex();
                boolean isEuicc = uiccCardInfo.isEuicc();

                // log or use the obtained UiccCardInfo
                Log.d("UiccCardInfo", "CardId: " + cardId + ", SlotIndex: " + slotIndex + ", IsEuicc: " + isEuicc);
            }
        } else {
            Log.d("UiccCardInfo", "No Uicc Card Info available");
        }
    } else {
        Log.d("UiccCardInfo", "API version does not support getting Uicc Card Info");
    }
}
```
