Here is the example of using NfcA's getTimeout method in a test method called `test_NfcA_getTimeout`. For this, you need to get the NfcA instance by calling the static method `NfcA.get(tag)`. The `getTimeout` method returns the response timeout in milliseconds.

```java
import android.nfc.Tag;
import android.nfc.tech.NfcA;
import android.util.Log;

public void test_NfcA_getTimeout() {
    try {
        // Create a dummy NFC tag for the sake of the example
        Tag dummyTag = Tag.CREATOR.createFromParcel(null);
        
        // Get an instance of NfcA using the dummyTag.
        NfcA nfcA = NfcA.get(dummyTag);
        
        // Get the timeout
        int timeout = nfcA.getTimeout();
        
        // Log or Use the timeout
        Log.d("NfcA Timeout", "Timeout: " + timeout + " milliseconds");
    } catch (Exception e) {
        // Handle any exceptions
        Log.d("NfcA Timeout", "Exception: " + e.toString());
    }
}
```

Please do not completely copy and paste above code. This is a mock code, in real use case, you will not be creating a dummy Tag. You'll have to provide a real NFC `Tag` object that you usually get from `onNewIntent` method of an NFC-enabled activity when an NFC tag comes into its proximity. Creating a Tag from parcel like the example is not a best practice and should be avoided.

Also, make sure to understand that while running this on your actual Android application, it requires the `android.permission.NFC` permission.

For this test, also the android device must have NFC hardware enabled and available. Always put null object checks to avoid NullPointerException.
