Here is a usage example of using `FillResponse.Builder` to create a FillResponse and set authentication with `setAuthentication()` method:

```java
@TargetApi(Build.VERSION_CODES.O)
public void test_FillResponse_setAuthentication() {
    IntentSender intentSender = PendingIntent.getActivity(
        this, 
        0, 
        new Intent(this, MainActivity.class),
        PendingIntent.FLAG_UPDATE_CURRENT
    ).getIntentSender();
    
    AutofillId autofillId = new AutofillId(1);

    // Create an array of AutofillId to be passed into setAuthentication() method
    AutofillId[] autofillIds = new AutofillId[]{ autofillId };

    // Create a FillResponse
    FillResponse fillResponse = new FillResponse.Builder()
        .setAuthentication(autofillIds, intentSender, new Dataset.Builder().build())
        .build();

    // Log the FillResponse for debugging
    Log.d("FillResponseTest", fillResponse.toString());
}
```

Note: This is just an example and may not work on your code depending on several things such as the version of Android you're running or other dependencies. In this example, `MainActivity.class` has been used, please replace it with the name of the class that you want to start when an item in this `FillResponse` requires authentication. The `AutofillId` used here is also just for example purposes, you'll want to replace it with the actual `AutofillId` of the view that needs to be autofilled.

You may need to handle the authentication in the activity that is started by the `IntentSender`. In the above example, the `MainActivity` would be responsible for checking the user's credentials and then, if the authentication succeeds, setting the autofill value for the view identified by the `AutofillId`.
