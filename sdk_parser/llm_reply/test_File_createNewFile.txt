Here is the example of a method that uses java/io/File.java API's createNewFile method. This method is used to create a new file, given a certain path. 

Please note that due to the nature of File I/O operations, they can throw an IOException, so we have to handle or declare that in our method:

```java
private void test_File_createNewFile(){
    //creating a new file instance
    File file = new File("/path/to/file.txt");

    //checks if the file exists
    if(!file.exists()){
        try {
            //trying to create a new file
            if(file.createNewFile()){
                Log.d("File Operations", "File created : " + file);
            }else{
                Log.d("File Operations", "File not created");
            }
        }catch (IOException e){
            Log.d("File Operations", "Error while creating file " + e.getMessage());
        }
    }else{
        Log.d("File Operations", "File already exists: " + file);
    }
}
```
In this example, a new file instance is created linking to a file located at "/path/to/file.txt". Then it checks if the file already exists. If it doesn't exists, it tries to create a new file. If the file is created successfully It logs a message that the file was created. 

If there is an error while creating a file (for example, due to lack of permissions), it logs an error message.

Finally, if the file already exists, it simply logs a message that the file already exists.

You would need to import the following packages at the top of your file:

```java
import java.io.File;
import java.io.IOException;
import android.util.Log;
```
