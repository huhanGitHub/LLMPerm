Below is an example usage of the `TouchInteractionController` API in Android:

First, please ensure to include the following permission in your `AndroidManifest.xml`
```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_SECURE_SETTINGS"/>
```
Then you can use the `TouchInteractionController` like below:

```java
import android.accessibilityservice.AccessibilityService;
import android.accessibilityservice.TouchInteractionController;
import android.view.MotionEvent;

public class MyActivity extends Activity {

    private AccessibilityService mService;
    private TouchInteractionController touchInteractionController;

    @Override 
    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);
        
        mService = new AccessibilityService() {
            // Add required methods...
        };

        touchInteractionController = mService.getTouchInteractionController();
        test_TouchInteractionController_performClick(100.0f, 100.0f);
    }

    public void test_TouchInteractionController_performClick(float x, float y) {
        long downTime = SystemClock.uptimeMillis();
        long eventTime = SystemClock.uptimeMillis();

        // Create a "down" event
        MotionEvent downEvent = MotionEvent.obtain(downTime, eventTime, MotionEvent.ACTION_DOWN, x, y, 0);

        // Create an "up" event
        MotionEvent upEvent = MotionEvent.obtain(downTime, eventTime, MotionEvent.ACTION_UP, x, y, 0);

        // Perform our "click"
        if(touchInteractionController != null) {
            touchInteractionController.injectEvents(downEvent, upEvent, (completed) -> {
                if (completed) Log.d("TAG","Click performed");
                else Log.d("TAG","Click not performed");
            });
        } else Log.d("TAG", "TouchInteractionController not available");
    }
}
```

Please note that, You need to obtain the `TouchInteractionController` from `AccessibilityService`. However, please keep in mind that the use of TouchInteractionController outside of the AccessibilityService context is restricted as the service provides access to sensitive user data.

Additionally, due to its security implications, the `WRITE_SECURE_SETTINGS` permission is not normally granted to third-party apps. It is used by system apps or apps signed with the system key.
