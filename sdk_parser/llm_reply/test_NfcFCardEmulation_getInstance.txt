The NfcFCardEmulation class is not directly used, therefore attempting to getInstance() of this class won't work and writing test_NfcFCardEmulation_getInstance isn't feasible. 

However, we can exemplify a case of usage for NfcAdapter, which is related to Near Field Communication, and check for NFC permissions:

(NfcFCardEmulation is a hidden Class, however, it can be used indirectly by CardEmulation class methods)

```java
public void test_GetNfcAdapterInstance() {
    // Check if the device supports NFC
    NfcAdapter nfcAdapter = NfcAdapter.getDefaultAdapter(this);

    // Check if NFC is turned on, if not, navigate to NFC settings
    if (nfcAdapter != null && !nfcAdapter.isEnabled()) {
        Toast.makeText(this, "Please enable NFC to test", Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show();
        startActivity(new Intent(Settings.ACTION_NFC_SETTINGS));
    }
    // If NFC is available and enabled
    else if (nfcAdapter != null && nfcAdapter.isEnabled()) {
        // Now we can use the NfcAdapter instance here:
        // nfcAdapter.xxx();
        Toast.makeText(this, "NFC is available on your device", Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show();
    }
    else {
        Toast.makeText(this, "NFC not available on your device", Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show();
    }
}
```

Please include the necessary permissions in Android manifest file:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.NFC" />
```

If requirement is to use Card Emulation Mode, Android requires devices to be desegregated using host-based Card Emulation Mode (HCE). Hence, you need the below permissions in manifest file:

```xml
<uses-feature android:name="android.hardware.nfc.hce" android:required="true" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BIND_NFC_SERVICE" />
```

For this, an android Service that extends `HostApduService` is to be created. `HostApduService` callbacks like `processCommandApdu(byte[] commandApdu, Bundle extras)` handles APDU commands sent from reader mode NFC devices. This is how `NfcCardEmulation` instances are commonly used.
