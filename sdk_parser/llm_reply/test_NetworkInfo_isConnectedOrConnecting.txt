Below is the example of a method named `test_NetworkInfo_isConnectedOrConnecting` that could be used in an Android activity. This method checks if the device is currently connected to a network, or is in the process of connecting:

```java
import android.content.Context;
import android.net.ConnectivityManager;
import android.net.NetworkInfo;

public void test_NetworkInfo_isConnectedOrConnecting() {
    // Get the ConnectivityManager instance
    ConnectivityManager connectivityManager = (ConnectivityManager) getSystemService(Context.CONNECTIVITY_SERVICE);

    // Check if the service instance is not null
    if (connectivityManager != null) {
        // Get the active network info
        NetworkInfo activeNetworkInfo = connectivityManager.getActiveNetworkInfo();

        // Check if the network info is not null and isConnectedOrConnecting method returns true
        if (activeNetworkInfo != null && activeNetworkInfo.isConnectedOrConnecting()) {
            System.out.println("Device is currently connected to a network, or is in the process of connecting");
        } else {
            System.out.println("Device is not connected to a network, or is not in the process of connecting");
        }
    } else {
        System.out.println("Failed to get the ConnectivityManager instance");
    }
}
```

This method utilizes the `ConnectivityManager` class, which is an Android class that answers queries about the state of network connectivity. It also notifies applications when network connectivity changes.

In this case, `ConnectivityManager` and `NetworkInfo` are being used to determine whether the device is connected to a network, or is in the process of connecting. If the `isConnectedOrConnecting` method of `NetworkInfo` returns `true`, it means that the device currently has network connectivity or is establishing a network connection. Otherwise, the device does not have network connectivity and is not in the process of establishing a network connection.
