In Android, to get information about a UICC card, you would use the class android.telephony.UiccCardInfo. However, please note that this feature is only available from API version 29 (Android 10.0) onwards. Below is an example of a test method using that:

```java
import android.telephony.SubscriptionInfo;
import android.telephony.SubscriptionManager;
import android.telephony.TelephonyManager;
import android.telephony.UiccCardInfo;

public void test_UiccCardInfo_getEid(Activity activity) {
    // Check if app has permissions to read phone state
    if (ContextCompat.checkSelfPermission(activity, Manifest.permission.READ_PHONE_STATE) 
            != PackageManager.PERMISSION_GRANTED) {
        ActivityCompat.requestPermissions(activity, new String[]{Manifest.permission.READ_PHONE_STATE}, 1);
        return;
    }

    // Acquire a reference to the system Telephony Manager
    TelephonyManager telephonyManager = (TelephonyManager) activity.getSystemService(Context.TELEPHONY_SERVICE);

    // Use the telephonyManager to get the Uicc Card information.
    if (android.os.Build.VERSION.SDK_INT >= android.os.Build.VERSION_CODES.Q) {
        List<UiccCardInfo> uiccCardInfoList = telephonyManager.getUiccCardsInfo();

        // Loop through each available card
        for (UiccCardInfo uiccCardInfo : uiccCardInfoList) {
            // Retrieve the EID of each card
            String eid = uiccCardInfo.getEid();

            // Print EID to logs
            Log.i("UiccCardInfo", "Card EID: " + eid);
        }
    } else {
        Log.i("UiccCardInfo", "UiccCardInfo not supported on this device/version");
    }
}
```
This code checks and asks for READ_PHONE_STATE permission, obtains the system Telephony Manager, and uses it to get a list of UiccCardInfo objects. For each UiccCardInfo object, it calls the getEid() method to retrieve the EID of the card and then logs that string.

Notice that this code will work only on Android version 10 and higher. This is a limitation of the Android API, not the code itself, as the UiccCardInfo class is only available in Android 10 and later. Furthermore, ensure your app has the required READ_PHONE_STATE permission.
