Here is an example of a method that demonstrates the usage of the `java/security/Permissions.java` API. Note that this sample code is a simple setUp test; please modify it to fit your own needs.

For this method, we're adding a pair of permissions to a Permissions object, then checking if the permissions have been correctly added.

Please add the required import statements at the start of your file while implementing this in your application 

``` java
import java.security.Permission;
import java.security.Permissions;
import java.io.FilePermission;

public void test_Permissions_add()  {
    // Create a new Permissions object
    Permissions permissions = new Permissions();

    // Create two new FilePermission objects
    FilePermission readPerm = new FilePermission("/home/nobody/","read");
    FilePermission writePerm = new FilePermission("/home/nobody/","write");

    // Add the FilePermission objects to the Permissions object
    permissions.add(readPerm);
    permissions.add(writePerm);

    // Verifying permissions
    if(!permissions.implies(new FilePermission("/home/nobody/","read"))){
        System.out.println("Read permission not correctly added.");
    }
    if(!permissions.implies(new FilePermission("/home/nobody/","write"))){
        System.out.println("Write permission not correctly added.");
    }
}
``` 

Side notes:
1. In Android, you don't have to manage Permissions yourself; Android has its own permission system.
2. java.security.permissions are for the JVM and are not related to Android permissions in any way.
