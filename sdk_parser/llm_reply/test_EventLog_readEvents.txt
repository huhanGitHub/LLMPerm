Unfortunately, currently, Android doesn't provide a public API to directly access the EventLog mentioned which includes system level logs. Directly trying to access the Event log may result in a 'SecurityException' as it requires READ_LOGS permission which is not granted to apps on devices running Android 4.1 and later.

However, you can access these logs using Android Debug Bridge (ADB).

Example:
```shell
adb logcat -b events
```
In case you wish to process your application-specific log records, you still can use Log API to create own logging system. The sample below demonstrates a simple usage of this API.

```java
public class MainActivity extends AppCompatActivity {
    private static final String TAG = "MyApp";
    
    @Override
    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);
        test_EventLog_readEvents();
    }

    public void test_EventLog_readEvents() {
        Log.d(TAG, "Debug log message");
        Log.i(TAG, "Info log message");
        Log.w(TAG, "Warning log message");
        Log.e(TAG, "Error log message");

        try {
            Process process = Runtime.getRuntime().exec("logcat -d");
            BufferedReader bufferedReader = new BufferedReader(
                    new InputStreamReader(process.getInputStream()));

            StringBuilder log=new StringBuilder();
            String line;

            while ((line = bufferedReader.readLine()) != null) {
                if(line.contains(TAG)){ // Filter by your tag
                    log.append(line);
                    // Process log data
                }
            }    
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```
Please note, reading the log programmatically in this way requires the READ_LOGS permission:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_LOGS" />
```
This permission is not granted for ordinary Android applications and you can't make use of it to read other app's logs as a security measure from Android 4.1 onwards.
