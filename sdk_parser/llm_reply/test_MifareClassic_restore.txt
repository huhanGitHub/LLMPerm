The following is a testing method for restoring MifareClassic in Android:

```Java
// includes
import android.nfc.Tag;
import android.nfc.tech.MifareClassic;
import android.os.Bundle;
import android.util.Log;

// other code...

public void test_MifareClassic_restore() {
    try {
        // assuming tag is the NFC tag detected by your device
        Tag tag = null;

        MifareClassic mifareClassic = MifareClassic.get(tag);
        if (mifareClassic == null) {
            Log.e("MifareClassic", "Tag is not MifareClassic, and cannot be restored");
            return;
        }

        // each sector on the card must be authenticated prior to read/write
        final int sectorCount = mifareClassic.getSectorCount();
        byte[] keys = MifareClassic.KEY_DEFAULT;

        mifareClassic.connect();

        // Restore every sector
        for (int i = 0; i < sectorCount; i++) {
            if (mifareClassic.authenticateSectorWithKeyA(i, keys)) {
                Log.v("MifareClassic", "Secured with KeyA of sector " + i);
            } else {
                // No need to continue if authentication has failed
                Log.v("MifareClassic", "Failed to authenticate sector " + i);
                break;
            }
        }

        // Restore finished, close the connection
        mifareClassic.close();
        Log.v("MifareClassic", "Restore operation completed");

    } catch (Exception e) {
        Log.e("MifareClassic", "Failed to restore MifareClassic card", e);
    }
}
```
Please note, this code is assuming the `Tag` object has been initialized. You need to implement the `Tag` discovering mechanism on your own. Normally this would be established in an `onCreate` of an `activity` or `onNewIntent`. Above method will attempt to authenticate each sector in the card with the default KEY_A, you should modify this according to your needs.

So, this is an example of how to perform the restore operation, you might want to handle the errors and retry or display messages to the user. Another important point to consider is that you should generally perform network operations on a separate thread than the UI thread using AsyncTask or with similar solutions.
