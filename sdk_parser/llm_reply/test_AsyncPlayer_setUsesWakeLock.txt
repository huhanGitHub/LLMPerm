Here is a simple example of a test method function for `setUsesWakeLock` from the `AsyncPlayer` class in Android:

```java
@RequiresApi(api = Build.VERSION_CODES.LOLLIPOP)
public void test_AsyncPlayer_setUsesWakeLock() {
    Context context = getApplicationContext();

    // check if the WAKE_LOCK permission is granted
    if (ContextCompat.checkSelfPermission(context, Manifest.permission.WAKE_LOCK)
            != PackageManager.PERMISSION_GRANTED) {

        // if not granted, request the permission
        ActivityCompat.requestPermissions(this,
                new String[]{Manifest.permission.WAKE_LOCK}, 1);
    } else {

        // if permission is already granted, continue with the setUsesWakeLock
        AsyncPlayer asyncPlayer = new AsyncPlayer("test");
        PowerManager powerManager = (PowerManager) getSystemService(POWER_SERVICE);
        PowerManager.WakeLock wakeLock = powerManager.newWakeLock(PowerManager.PARTIAL_WAKE_LOCK,     
        "app:MyWakeLock");

        // set whether the AsyncPlayer instance should use a wake lock to make sure the device doesn't sleep while it's playing
        asyncPlayer.setUsesWakeLock(wakeLock);

        // check the wake lock
        if(wakeLock.isHeld()){
            Log.d("test_AsyncPlayer", "WakeLock is held");
        } else {
            Log.d("test_AsyncPlayer", "WakeLock is not held");
        }

        // cleanup after test
        asyncPlayer.stop();
        if(wakeLock.isHeld()){
            wakeLock.release();
        }

    }
}
```

Please note that this code is an illustrative example and implies that the test is being run from an Activity and the necessary imports are in place. Also, the code assumes that you're using Android 6.0 (Marshmallow) or higher, as these versions require runtime permissions. For the actual application, you should properly handle the result of the permission request in `onRequestPermissionsResult`.

The context reference (`getApplicationContext()` or `this`) needs to be adapted depending on where you plan to put this function, it might not compile if this function isn't placed inside an activity or other context accessible class.
