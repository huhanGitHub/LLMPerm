In order to use BlockedNumberContract API, the app must be granted with the "READ_BLOCKED_NUMBERS" and "WRITE_BLOCKED_NUMBERS" permissions.

Below is an example of an Android API using BlockedNumberContract to get Enhanced Block Setting in Java.

```java
@RequiresApi(api = Build.VERSION_CODES.N)
public void test_BlockedNumberContract_getEnhancedBlockSetting () {

    // Check if permissions are granted
    if (checkSelfPermission(Manifest.permission.READ_BLOCKED_NUMBERS) != PackageManager.PERMISSION_GRANTED ||
            checkSelfPermission(Manifest.permission.WRITE_BLOCKED_NUMBERS) != PackageManager.PERMISSION_GRANTED) {

        // Request permissions
        requestPermissions(new String[] {Manifest.permission.READ_BLOCKED_NUMBERS, Manifest.permission.WRITE_BLOCKED_NUMBERS}, 1);
    } else {

        // Get Content Resolver
        ContentResolver contentResolver = getContentResolver();
        
        Uri enhancedBlockUri = BlockedNumberContract.BlockedNumbers.ENHANCED_SETTING_CONTENT_URI;

        try {
            Cursor cursor = contentResolver.query(enhancedBlockUri, new String[]{BlockedNumberContract.BlockedNumbers.COLUMN_ID}, 
            null, null, null);

            if (cursor != null) {
                if (cursor.moveToFirst()) {
                    int enhancedBlockingEnabled = cursor.getInt(cursor.getColumnIndex(BlockedNumberContract.BlockedNumbers.COLUMN_E164_NUMBER));
                    Toast.makeText(this, "Enhanced Blocking Enabled : " + enhancedBlockingEnabled, Toast.LENGTH_LONG).show();
                }
                cursor.close();
            }
        } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

Please remember, starting from Android 10, the APIs for call blocking are not available to third-party apps. An app that's not a default phone handler cannot read the call log and the Blocked Numbers Provider. So make sure your app is the default phone handler or use this in a system or carrier app.

Also to test the method above, your app must be signed with the same signature as the system dialer app. Otherwise, a SecurityException will be thrown. This makes it difficult to run this test on an actual device.

Refer [BlockedNumberContract Documentation](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/provider/BlockedNumberContract) for more details on this.
