Here is a basic example of how you may use the `MtpDevice.open` method within a test method named `test_MtpDevice_open` in an Android activity:

```java
import android.mtp.MtpDevice;
import android.mtp.MtpDeviceInfo;
import android.mtp.MtpObjectInfo;
import android.mtp.MtpStorageInfo;
import android.os.storage.StorageManager;
import android.os.storage.StorageVolume;
import android.os.Environment;

public void test_MtpDevice_open() {
    // In real usage, this should be the collected UsbDevice from Android's USB APIs, not null.
    UsbDevice usbDevice = null;
    MtpDevice mtpDevice = new MtpDevice(usbDevice);
    
    // Before you can use the device, you must open it.
    boolean isOpen = mtpDevice.open();

    // If the device has been successfully opened, proceed to use it.
    if (isOpen) {
        // Get device info.
        MtpDeviceInfo deviceInfo = mtpDevice.getDeviceInfo();

        // Use the device. For instance, get all storage IDs.
        int[] storageIds = mtpDevice.getStorageIds();

        // Further operations...

        // Remember to close the device when you are done.
        mtpDevice.close();
    } else {
        // Handle the error. The device could not be opened.
        throw new IllegalStateException("Could not open MTP device.");
    }
}
```

IMPORTANT: This code snippet is a simple representation of using `MtpDevice.open()` method. In a real application setup, you need to handle USB connections by implementing `USB Host` APIs to collect the `UsbDevice` instance. And you always have to take into account user permissions for accessing USB devices.

This example assumes that `UsbDevice` is available. Then it opens the MTP device, gets device info, and storage's IDs as a simple operation. After the operations, the device is closed. If the device cannot be opened for any reason, an exception is simply thrown.

Remember to handle possible `null` on `usbDevice` in any production code.
