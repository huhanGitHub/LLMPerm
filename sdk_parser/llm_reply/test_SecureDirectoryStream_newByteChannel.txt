Here is a method showcasing the use of `SecureDirectoryStream`'s `newByteChannel` method:

```java
@RequiresApi(api = Build.VERSION_CODES.O)
public void test_SecureDirectoryStream_newByteChannel() {
    Path path = Paths.get(Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory().toString() + "/test.txt");

    // Checking for the required permission
    if (checkSelfPermission(Manifest.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE) == PackageManager.PERMISSION_GRANTED) {
        OpenOption[] options = new OpenOption[]{StandardOpenOption.WRITE, StandardOpenOption.CREATE};
        Set<PosixFilePermission> perms = PosixFilePermissions.fromString("rw-r--r--");

        FileAttribute<Set<PosixFilePermission>> attr = PosixFilePermissions.asFileAttribute(perms);

        try {
            SecureDirectoryStream<Path> secureDirectoryStream = (SecureDirectoryStream<Path>)
                    Files.newDirectoryStream(path.getParent());
            secureDirectoryStream.newByteChannel(path.getFileName(), options, attr);

            secureDirectoryStream.close();
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    } else {
        requestPermissions(new String[]{Manifest.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE}, 0);
    }
}
```
Please ensure you have the required permissions to read/write storage in the manifest file of your Android project. Also, `SecureDirectoryStream` is a interface which provides more secure mechanism for directories and can be applied only when you're using a file system that supports Posix permissions.
  
This `test_SecureDirectoryStream_newByteChannel()` is an example of a method which creates a new byte channel to open an existing file in the directory, writes it with specified options (`CREATE` and `WRITE`) and sets the posix file permissions (`rw-r--r--`) which means - Read/Write for owner, Read for group and others.

In this case, I have chosen a file from external storage for demonstration. Replace it with the appropriate path/file from your application's directory.
