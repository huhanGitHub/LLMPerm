Sure, here's a simple example of how you could create a test method within an Android Unit testing class to test the `sendDtmf(int code)` method of `SipAudioCall`. 

Please be aware that this example assumes that you understand the SIP protocol, have a properly set up SIP server, and have permissions in your application to use Internet, microphone and `READ_PHONE_STATE`.

```java
@Test
public void test_SipAudioCall_sendDtmf() {
    try {
        // Initialize SIP Manager
        SipManager manager = SipManager.newInstance(InstrumentationRegistry.getInstrumentation().getTargetContext());

        // Initialize SipProfile
        SipProfile.Builder builder = new SipProfile.Builder("USERNAME", "DOMAIN");
        builder.setPassword("PASSWORD");

        // Register SipProfile
        SipProfile profile = builder.build();
        manager.open(profile);

        // Make a call
        SipAudioCall call = manager.makeAudioCall(profile.getUriString(), "sip:destination@domain.com", null, 30);

        // Send DTMF
        int code = 1; //Replace with your DTMF code
        call.sendDtmf(code);

        // End call
        call.endCall();

    } catch (SipException e) {
        fail();
    } catch (IllegalArgumentException e) {
        fail();
    } catch (InterruptedException e) {
        fail();
    }
}
```

This example uses `SipManager` and `SipProfile` to establish a SIP audio call and send a DTMF tone through that call. `SipManager` is used to establish a SIP protocol, and `SipProfile` is used to register particular SIP accounts. The `makeAudioCall` method is used to make a SIP audio call, and `sendDtmf` is used to send a DTMF tone.

The exceptions are for the purpose of the test, to ensure that if anything goes wrong, the test fails.

Note: For simplicity, hardcoded strings were used to set up the `SipProfile`. Please use string resources or get that information safely from your server in a real-world scenario. You would also normally move SIP communication to its own class to better handle errors and other events.
