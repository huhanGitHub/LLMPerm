Here's a method test_AudioPlaybackCaptureConfiguration_addMatchingUid that serves as an usage example of android API AudioPlaybackCaptureConfiguration. As per your request, this method does not relate to an android permission test also AudioPlaybackCaptureConfiguration requires Android Q (API level 29) and higher. 

```java
@RequiresApi(api = Build.VERSION_CODES.Q)
public void test_AudioPlaybackCaptureConfiguration_addMatchingUid(Context context) {
    // Starts with an audio recording source definition
    MediaProjection mMediaProjection = ((MediaProjectionManager) context.getSystemService(Context.MEDIA_PROJECTION_SERVICE)).getMediaProjection(Activity.RESULT_OK, new Intent());
    AudioPlaybackCaptureConfiguration originalConfig = mMediaProjection.createAudioPlaybackCaptureConfiguration();
    
    // Gets list of packages that produce audio for the above config
    List<AudioPlaybackCaptureConfiguration.AppCapturePolicy> originalPolicyList = originalConfig.getMatchingPackages();

    // Adding a matching UID of another audio producing app
    try {
        int uid = context.getPackageManager().getPackageUid("com.example.otherapp", 0);
        AudioPlaybackCaptureConfiguration newConfig = originalConfig.addMatchingUid(uid);

        // Verifying if the addition was successful
        List<AudioPlaybackCaptureConfiguration.AppCapturePolicy> newPolicyList = newConfig.getMatchingPackages();
        boolean isAdditionSuccessful = false;

        for (AudioPlaybackCaptureConfiguration.AppCapturePolicy appCapturePolicy : newPolicyList) {
            if (appCapturePolicy.uid == uid) {
                isAdditionSuccessful = true;
                break;
            }
        }

        if (isAdditionSuccessful)
            Log.i("AudioCaptureTest", "The new UID is successfully added!");
        else
            Log.i("AudioCaptureTest", "Failed to add the new UID!");

    } catch (PackageManager.NameNotFoundException e) {
        Log.e("AudioCaptureTest", "Error: Package not found", e);
    }
}
```

Note: In the example above, "com.example.otherapp" should be replaced with actual packageName of the app whose you want to add to your AudioPlaybackCaptureConfiguration, it must belong to an app running on the device. Also, MEDIA_PROJECTION is a system-level permission and needs to be granted beforehand.
