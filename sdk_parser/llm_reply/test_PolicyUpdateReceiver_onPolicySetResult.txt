In order to showcase a plausible context, let's assume that `PolicyUpdateReceiver` is a custom Broadcast Receiver that handles updates on device admin policies. And, `onPolicySetResult()` is a method that is triggered when there is a result from setting a policy.

Here is an example of how you could structure a code to test the function `onPolicySetResult()` within `PolicyUpdateReceiver.java`.

Please note the code will not make sense without the actual PolicyUpdateReceiver implementation as this is only an inference based on the sparse detail provided. 

```java
public void test_PolicyUpdateReceiver_onPolicySetResult(){
     PolicyUpdateReceiver policyUpdateReceiver = new PolicyUpdateReceiver();
     Intent intent = new Intent();

     // Add extra information to the intent if necessary, the given string is an example and should be replaced by relevant data
     intent.putExtra("POLICY_RESULT", "Policy Set");

     // Since onPolicySetResult is a callback method and its access is not suggested, 
     // we can test receiver's onReceive method, assuming it in turns calls onPolicySetResult
     policyUpdateReceiver.onReceive(this, intent);  // this refers to current context/activity
}
```

In the above method, we are creating an instance of `PolicyUpdateReceiver`. An Intent is also created and filled it with custom data. The `onReceive()` method is called on the `PolicyUpdateReceiver` object. 

This code should reside within your activity. Make sure you only call this function for testing purposes and it does not interfere with your main code workflow. Additionally, this only tests if the method works without throwing exceptions, for more thorough testing consider using proper testing frameworks.
