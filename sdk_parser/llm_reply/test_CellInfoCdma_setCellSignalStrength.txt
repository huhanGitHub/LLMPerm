Here is the example code for the `test_CellInfoCdma_setCellSignalStrength` method. 

Please note that directly setting the `CellSignalStrength` is not possible as Android does not provide setter methods for these objects. They are immutable and their values are managed solely by the operating system. However, you can retrieve these values. Here is an example:

```java
public void test_CellInfoCdma_setCellSignalStrength() {
    // Check if the permission has been granted 
    if(ContextCompat.checkSelfPermission(this, Manifest.permission.ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION) == PackageManager.PERMISSION_GRANTED) {
        // Initialize the telephony manager 
        TelephonyManager telephonyManager = (TelephonyManager) getApplicationContext().getSystemService(Context.TELEPHONY_SERVICE);
        
        if (telephonyManager != null) {
            // Get all the cell info objects
            List<CellInfo> cellInfos = telephonyManager.getAllCellInfo();
            // Iterate through the cell info objects 
            for (CellInfo cellInfo : cellInfos) {
                // Check if the cell info object is of type CellInfoCdma 
                if (cellInfo instanceof CellInfoCdma) {
                    CellInfoCdma cellInfoCdma = (CellInfoCdma) cellInfo;
                    // Get the cell signal strength 
                    CellSignalStrengthCdma cellSignalStrengthCdma = cellInfoCdma.getCellSignalStrength();
                    // Now you can do something with cellSignalStrengthCdma
                    // But, remember, you can't set it
                }
            }
        }
    } else {
        // Request for the permission
        ActivityCompat.requestPermissions(this, new String[]{Manifest.permission.ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION}, YOUR_REQUEST_CODE);
    }
}
```
Remember to replace `YOUR_REQUEST_CODE` with a unique request code to handle permission request results. You also need the following permission located in your `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION" />
```

Please note that this code might not work on devices with Android Q and above. Cellular information is now protected by a higher user-granted permission. The `ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION` is necessary for these Android versions.
