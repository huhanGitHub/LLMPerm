Here is a Java method called test_NeighboringCellInfo_getNetworkType that should run within an Android activity. This method is an example usage of the "NeighboringCellInfo.getNetworkType()" method located in the Telephony API of Android:

```java
import android.content.Context;
import android.telephony.NeighboringCellInfo;
import android.telephony.TelephonyManager;

/**
 * Test method to print network type of all neighboring cells found by device's primary cell
 */
public void test_NeighboringCellInfo_getNetworkType() {
    TelephonyManager telephonyManager = (TelephonyManager)getSystemService(Context.TELEPHONY_SERVICE);
    List<NeighboringCellInfo> neighboringCellInfoList = telephonyManager.getNeighboringCellInfo();

    for (NeighboringCellInfo neighboringCellInfo : neighboringCellInfoList) {
        int networkType = neighboringCellInfo.getNetworkType();

        String networkTypeString;

        switch (networkType) {
            case TelephonyManager.NETWORK_TYPE_GPRS:
                networkTypeString = "GPRS";
                break;
            case TelephonyManager.NETWORK_TYPE_EDGE:
                networkTypeString = "EDGE";
                break;
            case TelephonyManager.NETWORK_TYPE_CDMA:
                networkTypeString = "CDMA";
                break;
            case TelephonyManager.NETWORK_TYPE_UMTS:
                networkTypeString = "UMTS";
                break;
            case TelephonyManager.NETWORK_TYPE_HSDPA:
                networkTypeString = "HSDPA";
                break;
            case TelephonyManager.NETWORK_TYPE_HSUPA:
                networkTypeString = "HSUPA";
                break;
            case TelephonyManager.NETWORK_TYPE_HSPA:
                networkTypeString = "HSPA";
                break;
            default:
                networkTypeString = "UNKNOWN";
                break;
        }
        
        System.out.println("Neighboring Cell Network Type: " + networkTypeString);
    }
}
```
The above function first retrieves an instance of the "TelephonyManager" class, which acts as the primary API for managing all aspects of telephony on the device. A list of "NeighboringCellInfo" objects is retrieved using the "getNeighboringCellInfo()" method. It then loops through each "NeighboringCellInfo" object and gets their network type using the "getNetworkType()" method, and print it to the console.
