Below is a sample usage of Identity class and its `setInfo` method from `java.security` package in Android or JAVA API. Please note that Identity class, as well as whole `java.security.IdentityScope` is practically deprecated in Android and you should use KeyStore or other appropriate classes for identity management. 

However, for the sake of your question, I'm still providing a sample:

```java
import java.security.Identity;
import java.security.IdentityScope;
import java.security.KeyManagementException;

public class MainActivity extends AppCompatActivity {

    @Override
    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);

        test_Identity_setInfo();
    }

    public void test_Identity_setInfo() {
        try{
            // Create identity
            Identity identity = new Identity("TestIdentity", new IdentityScope("TestScope"));

            // Set Info
            identity.setInfo("Additional Info for this Identity");

            Log.d("MainActivity ", "Identity Info: " + identity.getInfo());

        } catch (KeyManagementException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

This code creates an instance of the deprecated `Identity` class, sets some information on it and then logs that information.

Please note that the creation of an `Identity` instance with an `IdentityScope` is only for illustrative purposes and should not be used in a real application, especially considering the deprecation status of these classes.

The use of `Identity` and related classes concerned with "system identity" has been superseded by the `java.security.Principal` interface and its subclasses such as `java.security.cert.X509Certificate` and `javax.security.auth.x500.X500Principal`.
