The following method demonstrates how to use the `isOverrideDeadlineExpired()` method from the `JobParameters` class in the Android JobScheduler API. This method returns true if the job's deadline has expired.

Please note that you'll need to create a job for this method and the handling for it in a JobService before using this method. 

Also note that this code needs to be placed inside a class that extends `JobService`.

```Java
import android.app.job.JobParameters;
import android.app.job.JobService;
import android.util.Log;

//...

public void test_JobParameters_isUserInitiatedJob(JobParameters params) {
    // Check if the job was initiated by user
    boolean isUserInitiatedJob = params.isOverrideDeadlineExpired();
    
    if(isUserInitiatedJob){
        Log.d("JobParametersTest", "Job was initiated by user");
    }
    else{
        Log.d("JobParametersTest", "Job wasn't initiated by user");
    }
}
```
Here, `params` is an instance of JobParameters that you get from the job's execute method. `isOverrideDeadlineExpired()` is a method available in the `JobParameters` class that returns true if job's deadline expired before the job got a chance to run.
