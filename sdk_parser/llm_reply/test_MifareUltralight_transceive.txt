Here is a sample function `test_MifareUltralight_transceive` which demonstrates how to use the `transceive(byte[] data)` function from `android.nfc.tech.MifareUltralight`.

```java
public void test_MifareUltralight_transceive(Tag tag) {
    MifareUltralight mifare = MifareUltralight.get(tag);

    try {
        mifare.connect();

        // Construct command details
        byte[] payload = new byte[4];
        // set command payload.. e.g write to page 4
        payload[0] = 1;   //page address
        payload[1] = 'A'; //data
        payload[2] = 'B'; //data
        payload[3] = 'C'; //data

        byte[] command = new byte[16];
        // Set command type (e.g., read or write)
        command[0] = (byte) 0xA2; //COMMAND_WRITE
        System.arraycopy(payload, 0, command, 1, payload.length);

        byte[] response = mifare.transceive(command);
        // transceive returns response from tag

        Log.i(TAG, "Response from tag: " + Arrays.toString(response));

    } catch (IOException e) {
        Log.e(TAG, "IOException while using MifareUltralight", e);
    } finally {
        try {
            mifare.close();
        } catch (IOException e) {
            Log.e(TAG, "IOException while closing MifareUltralight", e);
        }
    }
}
```

This method first checks if a specific tag supports the `MifareUltralight` technology using the static `get()` method. If it is supported, it connects to the tag using the `connect` method. 

Next, this method constructs a command payload to be written to the tag's page 4. It then uses the `transceive()` function of `MifareUltralight` to write this page and receive a response from the tagged device. 

This is just an example usage. In most cases, the specific payload used will depend on what operations you need to perform on the NFC chip or tag, and what those specific chips or tags support.

Please replace the command payload and type according to your needs. Make sure to handle exceptions properly. This method assumes you have the required `NFC` permissions in AndroidManifest.xml file and your device supports `NFC`.
