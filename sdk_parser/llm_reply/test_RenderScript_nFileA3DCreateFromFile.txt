Here is a sample method for using the `RenderScript.nFileA3DCreateFromFile` API in android. 

Please note that the `nFileA3DCreateFromFile` does not exist in the official Android RenderScript library. Hence, the given code is an assumption of how it could be implemented, assuming `nFileA3DCreateFromFile` method returns some kind of `FileA3D` object. If it exists in a custom library you're using, you might need to adjust the code. Apart from it, you should also ensure that you have the appropriate permissions to read the file in your Android application. 

```java
public void test_RenderScript_nFileA3DCreateFromFile(Context context, String filePath) {
    // Create a renderScript instance
    RenderScript rs = RenderScript.create(context);

    //Create a file
    File file = new File(filePath);

    // Validate the file actually exists
    if(!file.exists()){
        Log.e("RenderScriptTest", "File does not exist");
        return;
    }

    // Now create a FileA3D
    // Please note that FileA3D class or nFileA3DCreateFromFile method does not exist in the official Android docs.
    // If you are using some modified or custom library which provides these, your implementation might differ.
    FileA3D fileA3D = rs.nFileA3DCreateFromFile(file);

    // Do some operation on fileA3D
}
```

Replace `FileA3D` with whatever type your method `nFileA3DCreateFromFile` returns and then you can perform operations on this object.

Remember to add permission check or request for `android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` to read a file if it is stored in external storage.
