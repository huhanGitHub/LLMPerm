Testing the `newDirectoryStream()` method of the `FileSystemProvider` class in Java can be quite complex due to its dependencies and many use cases. Below is a simplified example that creates a directory stream and iterates through its paths:

Since `FileSystemProvider` is an abstract class, we will use `FileSystems.getDefault().provider()` to get the default file system provider.

Remember that this code needs proper exception handling and clean-up logic in a real-world scenario.

```java
import java.io.IOException;
import java.nio.file.*;

public void test_FileSystemProvider_newDirectoryStream() {
    // The directory we want to list
    Path directory = Paths.get("/some/directory/path/");

    // The file system provider 
    FileSystemProvider provider = FileSystems.getDefault().provider();

    try (DirectoryStream<Path> stream = provider.newDirectoryStream(directory, "*")) {
        for (Path file: stream) {
            System.out.println(file.getFileName());
        }
    } catch (IOException | DirectoryIteratorException x) {
        // IOException can never be thrown by the iteration.
        // In this snippet, it can // only be thrown by newDirectoryStream.
        System.err.println(x);
    }
}
```

This code will print all the file names in the specific directory that match the glob string `"*"`, which means all files.

The string `"*"` is a glob string. It is used to filter the files that will be iterated. You can replace it with any valid glob string.

Remember that you have to add error handling and cleaning up after yourself in real code.

This should be run in a thread other than the UI thread in Android since it involves file operations.
