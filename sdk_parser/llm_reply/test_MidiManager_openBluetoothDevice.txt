Sure, here is a sketch of how such a method might look with some code that does not necessarily perform meaningful actions but shows how you might interact with the API.

```java
@RequiresApi(api = Build.VERSION_CODES.M)
public void test_MidiManager_openBluetoothDevice() {
    // Get the MidiManager system service
    MidiManager midiManager = (MidiManager) getSystemService(Context.MIDI_SERVICE);

    // Let's assume that we have already paired a Bluetooth MIDI device, and the device's BluetoothDevice object is bluetoothDevice
    BluetoothDevice bluetoothDevice = ...; // You would get this from Android's Bluetooth APIs

    // This is the callback we will use when attempting to open the Bluetooth MIDI device
    MidiManager.OnDeviceOpenedListener callback = new MidiManager.OnDeviceOpenedListener() {
        @Override
        public void onDeviceOpened(MidiDevice device) {
            if (device == null) {
                Log.e("test", "Could not open device");
            } else {
                Log.i("test", "Device opened, now we can use it");
                // Here you might want to save the device object for later use,
                // or you might want to start using the device
            }
        }
    };

    // We now attempt to open the Bluetooth MIDI device
    midiManager.openBluetoothDevice(bluetoothDevice, callback, new Handler());
}
```

Remember this is a sketch of code, and will not run unless you replace the placeholder Bluetooth device injection and handle the {@link MidiDevice} instance appropriately. Plus, as indicated by {@link MidiManager#openBluetoothDevice} this code requires at least Android Marshmallow (6.0, API level 23).  

Also this code should be ran on the main thread as it involves UI manipulation. The code is not handling any kind of errors, does not handle situations where Bluetooth is turned off and does not clean up after itself. 

The main purpose of the code is to demonstrate the use of {@link MidiManager#openBluetoothDevice}.
