The following method `test_CallRedirectionService_placeCall` demonstrates how to use the `CallRedirectionService` in Android. Before you run this code, make sure the needed permissions are already granted. 

```java
@RequiresApi(api = Build.VERSION_CODES.Q)
public void test_CallRedirectionService_placeCall() {
    Uri phoneNumber = Uri.parse("tel:1234567890");

    TelecomManager telecomManager = (TelecomManager) this.getSystemService(Context.TELECOM_SERVICE);

    if (ActivityCompat.checkSelfPermission(this, Manifest.permission.CALL_PHONE) != PackageManager.PERMISSION_GRANTED) {
        // Request for CALL_PHONE permission
        ActivityCompat.requestPermissions(this, new String[]{Manifest.permission.CALL_PHONE}, REQUEST_PERMISSION_CALL_PHONE);
        return;
    }

    PhoneAccountHandle defaultOutgoingPhoneAccount = telecomManager.getDefaultOutgoingPhoneAccount("tel");

    Bundle extras = new Bundle();
    extras.putParcelable(TelecomManager.EXTRA_PHONE_ACCOUNT_HANDLE, defaultOutgoingPhoneAccount);

    telecomManager.placeCall(phoneNumber, extras);
}
```

This is a simple method for using the `TelecomManager's` `placeCall` function, which might trigger the call redirection service if one exists and is enabled on the device. You will need to replace `"tel:1234567890"` with the real number you wish to call. 

Please note that before you use the CALL_PHONE permission in your app, you have to request it from the user because it is considered a dangerous permission. The `ActivityCompat.requestPermissions` method is to request the CALL_PHONE permission from the user. You have to replace the `REQUEST_PERMISSION_CALL_PHONE` with your request code. 

The `@RequiresApi` notation is used here to indicate that `CallRedirectionService` requires at least Android Q (API level 29).

The main point here is, `telecomManager.placeCall(phoneNumber, extras)` could potentially trigger `CallRedirectionService.placeCall` if it is configured correctly in the system. But it is the system level service, a 3rd party application usually do not have permission to access it directly.
