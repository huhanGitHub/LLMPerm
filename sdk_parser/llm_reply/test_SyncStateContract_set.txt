Here's a usage example of the `SyncStateContract` class. This example provides a code snippet of an Android Activity where we use the account object and provider authority to construct a URI and this is passed to an Android system's ContentResolver to set some sync data:

```java
import android.accounts.Account;
import android.content.ContentResolver;
import android.content.Context;
import android.net.Uri;
import android.os.Bundle;
import android.provider.SyncStateContract;
import android.util.Log;

public void test_SyncStateContract_set() {

    try {
        // get instance of Account
        Account account = new Account("testAccount", "com.test.package");
        String authority = "com.test.provider";

        // construct URI with account and authority
        Uri uri = SyncStateContract.Helpers.getUriForAccount(account, authority);

        byte[] data = new byte[] {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}; // the data you want to set

        // get the ContentResolver and set the sync state
        ContentResolver resolver = this.getContentResolver();
        SyncStateContract.Helpers.set(resolver, uri, data);

    } catch (Exception exception) {
        Log.e("SyncStateContractTest", "Failed to test SyncStateContract: "+exception.getMessage());
    }

}
```

Please remember to replace the dummy data (e.g "testAccount", "com.test.package" and "com.test.provider") with your correct data. Also, the use of this method requires the `GET_ACCOUNTS` permission and any app using this method should declare this permission in its manifest file.

In addition, this code is trying to manipulate sync settings, which could have other side effects based on what your ContentProvider doing in sync operation, so please be cautious about its implications.
