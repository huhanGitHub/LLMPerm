Creating a method to demonstrate the use of `SecureDirectoryStream` in Java might be challenging as Android does not directly support `SecureDirectoryStream`. `SecureDirectoryStream` is a part of `java.nio.file` package from Java 7 which has limited usability in Android. For example, `SecureDirectoryStream` and related file I/O classes are available only on Android 8.0 (API level 26) and above. 

However, I can show you a general Java JDK7 and above compatible example of this method using `SecureDirectoryStream`.

Please be aware, this code wouldn't produce desired results if run in an Android environment as Android's native libraries are different from JDK's libraries.

```java
import java.nio.file.*;
import java.io.IOException;

public class MainActivity {

    public void test_SecureDirectoryStream_move() {

        Path dir1 = Paths.get("/path/to/directory1");
        Path dir2 = Paths.get("/path/to/directory2");
        Path fileToMove = Paths.get("fileToMove.txt");

        try (SecureDirectoryStream<Path> dirStream = (SecureDirectoryStream<Path>) Files.newDirectoryStream(dir1)) {
            dirStream.move(fileToMove, dir2.resolve(fileToMove), StandardCopyOption.REPLACE_EXISTING);
            System.out.println("File moved successfully");
        } catch (IOException ex) {
            System.err.println("An I/O error occurred: " + ex.getMessage());
        } catch (ClassCastException ex) {
            System.err.println("The provided path " + dir1 + " is not associated with a SecureDirectoryStream: " + ex.getMessage());
        }
    }
}
```

This code tries to move the file `fileToMove.txt` from the directory `directory1` to `directory2` using a `SecureDirectoryStream`. If the file already exists in `directory2`, it will be replaced (`StandardCopyOption.REPLACE_EXISTING`). 

If an `IOException` occurs, the code will catch and print the error message. If `dir1` is not associated with a `SecureDirectoryStream`, a `ClassCastException` will be thrown and the error message will be printed.
