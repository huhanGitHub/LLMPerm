Here is an example of how you could use the `ObjectOutputStream` class in Java. Please note that this class is not specific to Android.

```java
public static void test_ObjectOutputStream_verifySubclass() {
    ObjectOutputStream objectOutputStream = null;
    try {
        // create a new file with an ObjectOutputStream
        objectOutputStream = new ObjectOutputStream(new FileOutputStream("testFile.bin"));
        
        // write something in the file
        objectOutputStream.writeUTF("Hello World");

        // flush the stream to insure all of the information was written to 'testfile.bin'
        objectOutputStream.flush();

        // close output stream when we're done with it
        objectOutputStream.close();
    } catch(IOException ex) {
        ex.printStackTrace();
    } finally {
        if(objectOutputStream != null) {
            try {
                objectOutputStream.close();
            } catch(IOException ex) {
                ex.printStackTrace();
            }
        }
    }
}
```

This method will create a new `ObjectOutputStream` and use it to write a String "Hello World" into a binary file named "testFile.bin". The `flush()` method is used to ensure that the buffer is empty and all data has been written to the output, and `close()` to release the system resources tied to this stream. 

The method gets wrapped in a try-catch because the `ObjectOutputStream` constructor and its methods can throw an `IOException` if something goes wrong with I/O operations. In the final clause, an additional try-catch is added to try to close the stream if it was successfully opened, regardless of whether an exception occurred or not when using the stream.

This specific example does not directly work with subclasses because `ObjectOutputStream` is designed to serialize any serializable object and doesn't provide a method to only verify subclasses.
