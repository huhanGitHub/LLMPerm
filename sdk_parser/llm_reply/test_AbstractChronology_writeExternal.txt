Here is an example of a method `test_AbstractChronology_writeExternal` that showcases an example of how to use `java/time/chrono/AbstractChronology.java`:

```java
@Test
public void test_AbstractChronology_writeExternal() {
    try {
        ByteArrayOutputStream baos = new ByteArrayOutputStream();
        ObjectOutputStream oos = new ObjectOutputStream(baos);
        AbstractChronology ac = IsoChronology.INSTANCE;
        
        oos.writeObject(ac);
        oos.flush();
        
        ByteArrayInputStream bais = new ByteArrayInputStream(baos.toByteArray());
        ObjectInputStream ois = new ObjectInputStream(bais);
        
        AbstractChronology readAc = (AbstractChronology) ois.readObject();
        
        assertEquals(ac.getId(), readAc.getId());
        assertEquals(ac.getCalendarType(), readAc.getCalendarType());
    } catch (IOException | ClassNotFoundException e) {
        e.printStackTrace();
    }
}
```

**Please note:** This is a unit test method which is part of software testing, but it's not related to Android permissions. If you need a test related to Android permissions, an example on how to use a certain permission or a way to test Chronology with specific Android permissions, please specify your request further.

`java/time/chrono/AbstractChronology.java` is a Java API which is not Android specific and permissions in Android system are used to protect the system's resources and user's privacy, so the mentioned API doesn't require specific permissions to be used.

Also, it's important to note that the `AbstractChronology` class as the name implies, is an abstract class. This means you cannot create an instance of it directly. Instead, you can create an instance of a class that extends it (in the above example `IsoChronology` which represents the ISO calendar system).
