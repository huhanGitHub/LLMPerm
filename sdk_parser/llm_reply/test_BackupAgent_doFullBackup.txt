Here's a simple example of a method named `test_BackupAgent_doFullBackup` which is supposed to simulate a backup. Since there's no method as `doFullBackup`, I will use `onFullBackup` method from `BackupAgent`.

```java
public void test_BackupAgent_doFullBackup() {
    try {
        // Assuming we have sampleFile for testing purpose
        File sampleFile = new File("<sample_file_path>"); 

        // Creating an instance of File descriptor from the file
        ParcelFileDescriptor parcelFileDescriptor =
                ParcelFileDescriptor.open(sampleFile, ParcelFileDescriptor.MODE_READ_ONLY);

        // Creating an instance of FullBackup
        FullBackup fullBackup = new FullBackup();

        // Creating an instance of Backup Data Output
        BackupDataOutput dataOutput = new BackupDataOutput(parcelFileDescriptor.getFileDescriptor());

        try {
            // Perform the backup
            fullBackup.backupToTar("<package_name>", null, null, sampleFile.getParent(),
                    sampleFile.getName(), dataOutput);

            Log.d("TEST", "Backup was successful.");
        } catch (IOException e) {
            Log.e("TEST", "Failed to perform the backup", e);
        }
    } catch (FileNotFoundException e) {
        Log.e("TEST", "Cannot find the file to backup", e);
    }
}
```
Note: In the example above, you would replace `<sample_file_path>` with the path of the file you want to test backup on, and `<package_name>` with your application's package name. 

Keep in mind that performing a full backup operation like the one simulated in this test method is not trivial and requires a number of permissions, such as `android.permission.BACKUP`. Additionally, this method will not actually perform a backup operation, but rather simulate it. A real backup operation would be managed by the Android system and triggered under specific conditions. 

Ensure to use in a testing environment since making backups like this can often corrupt or cause data loss if not done properly, or directly interfere with the actual backup process managed by the system.
