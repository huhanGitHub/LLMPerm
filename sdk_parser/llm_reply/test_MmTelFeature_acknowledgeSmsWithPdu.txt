Sure, unfortunately MmTelFeature.java does not provide visibility to its methods for external use except its Listener's callbacks. acknowledgeSmsWithPdu is not a public method of the MmTelFeature class and hence cannot directly be used.

However, if we were to conduct a unit test on a hypothetical public acknowledgeSmsWithPdu method, you could do something similar to the following:

```java
public class MyActivity extends Activity {
    private MmTelFeature mMmTelFeature;

    @Override
    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);

        // Initialize your MmTelFeature object
        // Note: This is a hypothetical scenario because you cannot directly instantiate MmTelFeature normally,
        // this is just for the purpose of illustrating the test method example
        mMmTelFeature = new MmTelFeature();
    }

    public void test_MmTelFeature_acknowledgeSmsWithPdu() {
        // Define the parameters for the method acknowledgeSmsWithPdu
        int token = 12345;
        int messageRef = 123;
        int result = 0; // 0 means success, 1 means failure

        // Since it's an hypothetical scenario, we expect the method doesn't return any value (void)
     try {
        if (mMmTelFeature != null) {
                mMmTelFeature.acknowledgeSmsWithPdu(token, messageRef, result);
                Log.d("MmTelFeature", "Sms with pdu acknowledged successfully.");
            }
        } catch (Exception e) {
            Log.e("MmTelFeature", "Error acknowledging sms with pdu, " + e.getMessage());
        }
    }
}
```
In the above method, we assume that the MmTelFeature class provides a public method called acknowledgeSmsWithPdu. However, in reality, such function does not exist as a directly usable feature. Therefore, you may need to find an alternative based on your requirements.
