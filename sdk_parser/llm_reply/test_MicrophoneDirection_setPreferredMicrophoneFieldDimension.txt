In order to provide you with a method for testing the setPreferredMicrophoneFieldDimension method, I will create a method that changes this parameter and then verifies that the change was correctly applied. Please note, this API is not a part of official Android SDK and my following code serves as a hypothetical example:

```Java
import android.media.MicrophoneDirection;
import android.util.Log;

public void test_MicrophoneDirection_setPreferredMicrophoneFieldDimension() {
    try {
        // Initialize microphone direction
        MicrophoneDirection micDirection = new MicrophoneDirection();

        // Print the current preferred field dimension
        Log.d("Test", "Current preferred microphone field dimension: "
                + micDirection.getPreferredMicrophoneFieldDimension());

        // Set a new preferred field dimension
        micDirection.setPreferredMicrophoneFieldDimension(3);

        // Verify if the preferred field dimension value has been set correctly
        if(micDirection.getPreferredMicrophoneFieldDimension() == 3) {
            Log.d("Test", "Preferred microphone field dimension has been set correctly.");
        } else {
            Log.d("Test", "Preferred microphone field dimension has not been set correctly.");
        }
    } catch (Exception e) {
        Log.d("Test", "Exception occurred: " + e.getMessage());
    }
}
```

Kindly substitute the `MicrophoneDirection` object initialization, the `setPreferredMicrophoneFieldDimension` and `getPreferredMicrophoneFieldDimension` methods with appropriate real methods if you are using any custom library/API that provides similar functionality.

Remember to call `test_MicrophoneDirection_setPreferredMicrophoneFieldDimension()` within an activity, for instance in `onCreate()`.
