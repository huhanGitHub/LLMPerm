To use the android.net.wifi.hotspot2.pps.Credential API, you must first have a context in a Hotspot 2.0 Release 2 service.

The method `getImsi()` in Credential class needs an object of the class to call it. Also note that, this method is deprecated after API level 29. Therefore will work below android 10.0(Q). Here is the example method `test_Credential_getImsi()`:

```java
import android.net.wifi.hotspot2.pps.Credential;
import android.os.Build;
import android.util.Log;

public void test_Credential_getImsi(){
    if(Build.VERSION.SDK_INT <= Build.VERSION_CODES.P){
        Credential credential = new Credential();

        // You need to set IMSI before you get
        Credential.SimCredential simCredential = new Credential.SimCredential();
        simCredential.setImsi("testImsi12345");
        credential.setSimCredential(simCredential);

        String imsi = credential.getSimCredential().getImsi();
        Log.i("Credential IMSI: " , imsi);
    }else{
       Log.i("Test failed", "This method is deprecated at your API Level");
    }
}
```

You might need `android.permission.ACCESS_WIFI_STATE` permission to access certain methods in the `Credential` class. Make sure you have the necessary permissions in your app manifest:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_WIFI_STATE" />
```

This is mainly for the purpose of demonstration the `getImsi()` API. In a real-world application, you would generally need to deal with authentication and will get this `Credential` object from the system or user input.
