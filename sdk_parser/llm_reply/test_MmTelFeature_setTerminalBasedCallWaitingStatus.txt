In order to test the setTerminalBasedCallWaitingStatus method of MmTelFeature class, you will need to have an instance of MmTelFeature. Let's assume that we already have a MmTelFeature instance, called mmTelFeature. Here is a way how you could do it:

```java

public void test_MmTelFeature_setTerminalBasedCallWaitingStatus() {
    try {
        //Create a Context object
        Context context = this;

        // Use TelephonyManager to get IMS service
        TelephonyManager telephonyManager = (TelephonyManager) context.getSystemService(Context.TELEPHONY_SERVICE);
        
        if (telephonyManager == null) {
            Log.e("MmTelFeature Test", "Could not get the TelephonyManager.");
            return;
        }

        // Create MmTelFeature object
        MmTelFeature mmTelFeature = telephonyManager.getImsMmTelFeature();

        if (mmTelFeature == null) {
            Log.e("MmTelFeature Test", "Could not get the MmTelFeature.");
            return;
        }

        //Set terminal based call waiting status. The first parameter is the status (true/false), and the second is a pending intent that will be triggered when the operation is completed.
        mmTelFeature.setTerminalBasedCallWaitingStatus(true, PendingIntent.getBroadcast(
                this, 
                0, 
                new Intent("com.example.test.MmTelFeature_setTerminalBasedCallWaitingStatus"), 
                0));
        Log.d("MmTelFeature Test", "setTerminalBasedCallWaitingStatus executed successfully.");

     } catch (Exception e) {
         Log.e("MmTelFeature Test", "Error while setting TerminalBasedCallWaitingStatus.", e);
     }
}
```

In above code, I am setting the terminal-based call waiting status to true. Please note that sometimes it's not guaranteed to have MmTelFeature instance. Also, setting status may throw an exception because of security reasons or the device may not support it, so it's surrounded with a try/catch block.
