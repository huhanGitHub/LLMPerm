Sure, here is a basic example of a method that adds a security provider using java.security.Security for Android/Java:

```java
import java.security.Provider;
import java.security.Security;
import javax.crypto.Cipher;

public void test_Security_addProvider() {
    // Create a custom security provider
    Provider customProvider = new Provider("CustomProvider", 1.0, "Custom crypto provider"){
        {
            put("Cipher.AES", "com.example.CustomAESCipher");
        }
    };
    
    // Add the custom security provider
    int position = Security.insertProviderAt(customProvider, 1);

    // Try to use the custom provider
    try {
        Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance("AES", "CustomProvider");
        // Use the cipher...
    } catch (Exception e) {
        // Handle exceptions
        e.printStackTrace();
    }
}
```
This example is creating a custom security provider that has a single service for AES encryption. It inserts the provider at first place in the list of security providers (which means it will be preferred over others when services are being looked up), and then it attempts to use the service.

Keep in mind that the provided service class (com.example.CustomAESCipher) must actually exist and be implemented in your code, this is just illustrative of where you would put your class name. Also consider that adding/removing providers requires special permissions, hence this code should be run in a trusted environment and may not be suitable for unprivileged contexts such as mobile apps.

Final note and reminder: Manipulating Java's security providers is a serious action that should only be taken after thoroughly understanding the implications, as it can potentially make your software vulnerable to security attacks if not done correctly.
