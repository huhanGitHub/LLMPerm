In java/net/URLClassLoader.java, the URLClassLoader is a part of Java's standard library, not Android's. This class loader is used to load classes and resources from a search path of URLs referring to both JAR files and directories. Here is an example of how it can be used.

```java
import java.net.URLClassLoader;
import java.net.URL;
import java.lang.reflect.Method;
import java.io.File;

public static void test_URLClassLoader_run() {
  try {
    //path to the directory or JAR file
    File file = new File("/path/to/your/directory/or/JAR");

    //Convert File to a URL
    URL url = file.toURI().toURL();          
    URL[] urls = new URL[]{url};

    //Create a new class loader with the directory
    URLClassLoader clsLoader = new URLClassLoader(urls);

    //Load in the class; MyClass.class should be located in
    //the directory or file file:/path/to/your/directory/MyClass.class
    Class cls = clsLoader.loadClass("MyClass");

    //Create a new instance from the loaded class
    Object obj = cls.newInstance();

    //Getting a method from the loaded class and invoking it
    Method method = cls.getDeclaredMethod("myMethod");
    method.invoke(obj);
  } catch (Exception e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
  } 
}
```
This method is loading a class from a specified URL (which could be a file path or JAR file path), and then it's creating an instance of that class and invoking one of its method named 'myMethod'.

However, always be careful when using URLClassLoader along with reflection. The class or jar files that you are loading the classes from, can contain malicious code.
