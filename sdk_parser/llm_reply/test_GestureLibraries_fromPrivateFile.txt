Sure, here's an example usage of the GestureLibraries.java API, specifically the fromPrivateFile() method:

```java
//Location of an import of android/gesture/GestureLibraries for reference
import android.gesture.GestureLibraries;
import android.gesture.GestureLibrary;
import android.gesture.Gesture;
import android.gesture.Prediction;
import android.content.Context;

import java.io.File;
import java.util.ArrayList;

public void test_GestureLibraries_fromPrivateFile(Context context) {
    // Define the filename, located in the application's private file directory
    String fileName = "gestures";

    // Get the application's private file directory
    File file = context.getFileStreamPath(fileName);

    // Create a gesture library from a private file
    GestureLibrary gestureLibrary = GestureLibraries.fromPrivateFile(context, fileName);

    // Load the library
    boolean isLoadSuccess = gestureLibrary.load();

    if(isLoadSuccess){
        System.out.println("Gesture library successfully loaded.");

        // Consider hypothetical "exampleGesture" recognized through the android.gesture.GestureOverlayView
        Gesture exampleGesture = new Gesture();

        // Assuming the library is not empty and contains gestures,
        // identify the gesture in the library that most closely resembles "exampleGesture"
        ArrayList<Prediction> predictions = gestureLibrary.recognize(exampleGesture);
        
        if(predictions.size() > 0){
            Prediction bestPrediction = predictions.get(0);
            if(bestPrediction.score > 1.0){
                //Gesture is present in library with fair confidence, print gesture name to console
                System.out.println(bestPrediction.name);
            }
            else{
                //Gesture was not recognized confidently
                System.out.println("Gesture not recognized confidently.");
            }
        }
        else{
            System.out.println("No gestures recognized.");
        }
    }
    else{
        System.out.println("Failed to load gesture library.");
    }
}
```
This method takes in a context, and is intended to be integrated into an Android activity. Note that it assumes the existence of a gesture file in the specified location, and the methods called in the if-loop that depends on the successful loading of the library are just examples and would likely be changed based on application-specific requirements. The same applies for the gesture recognition section.

There seems to be missing a real gesture playback to create the "exampleGesture", which is beyond the scope of this question based only on the `fromPrivateFile` method.
