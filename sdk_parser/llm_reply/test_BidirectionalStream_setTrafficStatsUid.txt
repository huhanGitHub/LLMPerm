Here is a simple example of how you can use the `setTrafficStatsUid()` method in `BidirectionalStream`. Note that `setTrafficStatsUid(int uid)` method is used to attribute all network traffic that dependencies to the specified UID, typically the UID of the app that is executing the code.

Please take note that BidirectionalStream might not be directly accessible or available.

```java
import android.net.http.BidirectionalStream;
import android.net.TrafficStats;
import android.os.Process;
import android.util.Log;

public void test_BidirectionalStream_setTrafficStatsUid() {
    int currentAppUid = Process.myUid();

    // ensurePermission() check whether the Android system grants the caller
    // the permission to set the UID for network usage accounting.
    boolean hasPermission = TrafficStats.checkUidAccess(currentAppUid);
    if (!hasPermission) {
        Log.e("TestApp", "App doesn't have the necessary permissions.");
        return;
    }

    BidirectionalStream stream = /* Your way to create BidirectionalStream instance */;
    
    try {
      if (null != stream) {
        stream.setTrafficStatsUid(currentAppUid);
      }
    } catch (Exception e) {
        Log.e("TestApp", "Failed to set TrafficStatsUid: "+ e.getMessage());
    }
}
```

In the above code,

- We fetch the UID of the current app using `Process.myUid()`.
- We use `TrafficStats.checkUidAccess()` to check if our app has the necessary permissions to set the UID for network usage.
- If we have the necessary permissions, we create an instance of `BidirectionalStream` and set the TrafficStats UID of the stream to the current app's UID using the `setTrafficStatsUid()` method.
- If the app doesn't have the necessary permissions, or there's an exception when setting the TrafficStats UID, we log the error. 

Please ensure that the necessary permissions and methods are available and accessible in your specific use case. You may need to alter this sample code to fit your needs.
