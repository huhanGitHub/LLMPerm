Sure, but please note that `UserDictionary` needs the `WRITE_USER_DICTIONARY` permission, so don't forget to add it to your AndroidManifest.xml file.

Here is an example of how you may want to add a word to the UserDictionary:

```java
private void test_UserDictionary_addWord(Context context, String word, String shortcut) {
    if (Build.VERSION.SDK_INT >= Build.VERSION_CODES.JELLY_BEAN) {
        // On Jelly bean and above, direct user dictionary insertion is supported
        UserDictionary.Words.addWord(context, word, UserDictionary.Words.FREQUENCY_HIGH, shortcut, Locale.getDefault());
    } else {
        // On older versions, this feature is not supported
        Toast.makeText(context, "This feature is not supported on your device.", Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show();
    }
}
```
This method would add a word to the user dictionary with high frequency and an assigned shortcut. Please replace `Context context` with your object of `Context`. `String word, String shortcut` are the word and its shortcut that you want to add to the dictionary.

In order to execute this code successfully, you must include the following permission line to your AndroidManifest.xml file:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_USER_DICTIONARY" />
```

Please remember that this method is not supported on Android versions below Jelly Bean (API 16).
