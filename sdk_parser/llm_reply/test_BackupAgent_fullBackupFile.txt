Here's an example method for testing `BackupAgent.fullBackupFile()`. This method should reside inside an Activity.

Since `BackupAgent` class is abstract, we're not allowed to make an instance of it and directly use it. We can, however, implement it into our own custom backup agent class.

The `fullBackupFile()` requires permissions that include write access to external storage and `BACKUP` permission which is only granted to system applications.

This snippet will not work properly on a non-rooted device or a device that not running a custom firmware with your application being marked as a system app due to the required permissions.

Can't be tested in an Activity, needs an instance of backup agent which is created by the system.

```java
public class MyBackupAgent extends BackupAgent {
    @Override
    public void onBackup(ParcelFileDescriptor oldState, BackupDataOutput data, ParcelFileDescriptor newState) throws IOException {
        // Not relevant for this example
    }
    @Override
    public void onRestore(BackupDataInput data, int appVersionCode, ParcelFileDescriptor newState) throws IOException {
        // Not relevant for this example
    }

    public void test_BackupAgent_fullBackupFile() {
        // Check External Storage permission
        if(ContextCompat.checkSelfPermission(this, Manifest.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE) == PackageManager.PERMISSION_GRANTED) {
            // Check BACKUP permission
            if(ContextCompat.checkSelfPermission(this, "android.permission.BACKUP") == PackageManager.PERMISSION_GRANTED) {
                // Create file for backup
                File backupFile = new File(Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory(), "backup_test");
                try {
                    if(!backupFile.createNewFile()) {
                        Log.d("Backup Test", "File already exists or failed to create");
                    }
                    fullBackupFile(backupFile, new FullBackupDataOutput(new ParcelFileDescriptor.AutoCloseOutputStream(
                        ParcelFileDescriptor.open(new File(Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory(), "backup_test"),
                        ParcelFileDescriptor.MODE_READ_WRITE))));
                } catch(IOException e) {
                    e.printStackTrace();
                }
            } else {
                Log.d("Backup Test", "Backup permission not granted");
            }
        } else {
            Log.d("Backup Test", "Write External Storage permission not granted");
        }
    }
}
```

Again, note that this cannot be run on an emulator or a standard device because of the `BACKUP` permission. This is more a theoretical example and cannot be used in a traditional user-level application.
