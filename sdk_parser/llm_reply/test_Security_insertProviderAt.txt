Here is an example of a method named "test_Security_insertProviderAt". This method highlights the usage of the insertProviderAt() method within the java.security.Security class.

Please remember that inserting a new security provider might require appropriate security permissions in your application. Hence, you may need to check and request the necessary permissions beforehand.

Furthermore, please ensure you have a comprehensive understanding of the implications of adding a new Security Provider into your application, as it can influence all the future cryptographic operations.

Here's a sample method:

```java
import java.security.Provider;
import java.security.Security;

public void test_Security_insertProviderAt() {
    try {
        // Create a new test provider
        Provider provider = new Provider("TestProvider", 1.0, "Test Provider for insertProviderAt") {
        };

        // Insert the provider into the security list at a particular position
        final int position = 2; // please change it with your needs
        int resultCode = Security.insertProviderAt(provider, position);

        if (resultCode == -1) {
            System.out.println("Failed to insert the provider at the desired position");
        } else {
            System.out.println("Test provider was successfully inserted at the desired position");
        }

    } catch (Exception e) {
        e.printStackTrace();
    }
}
```
Please do update the exception handling block as this code only prints the stack trace for debugging purposes.

This method creates a new Provider with some example values, attempting to place it at the second position in the List of Java Security Providers. The method insertProviderAt() returns the actual position where the new Provider got placed, or -1 if the operation failed. This result is then printed out for debugging purposes.
