Here's a simple usage example of DrmManagerClient's `installDrmEngine()` method. This method installs a DRM plug-in (digital rights management) that is used for the access of DRM protected content.

```java
public void test_DrmManagerClient_installDrmEngine() {
    // Context of the application
    Context context = this.getApplicationContext();

    // Create an instance of DrmManagerClient
    DrmManagerClient client = new DrmManagerClient(context);

    // Specify DRM engine file path
    String drmEngineFilePath = "/path/to/drmEngineFile";

    // Install DRM engine
    DrmInfoRequest drmInfoRequest = new DrmInfoRequest(DrmInfoRequest.TYPE_REGISTRATION_INFO, "application/octet-stream");

    // Set the path to the DRM engine plug-in
    drmInfoRequest.put("file_path", drmEngineFilePath);

    try {
        // Proactively install the DRM engine plug-in
        DrmInfo drmInfo = client.acquireDrmInfo(drmInfoRequest);
        int result = client.processDrmInfo(drmInfo);

        // Check if the DRM engine was installed successfully
        if (result == DrmManagerClient.ERROR_NONE) {
            Log.d("DrmTest", "The DRM engine was installed successfully.");
        } else {
            Log.e("DrmTest", "Failed to install the DRM engine.");
        }
    } catch (Exception e) {
        Log.e("DrmTest", "An error occurred while installing the DRM engine.", e);
    }
}
```
Please replace "/path/to/drmEngineFile" with the real path of your DRM engine file. Also, note that you'll need to handle exceptions as necessary for your app's specific use case.

This code assumes that the `installDrmEngine()` function is invoked from an Activity, so `this` refers to the activity specifically. If the method is used in different context, you might need to obtain the context differently.
