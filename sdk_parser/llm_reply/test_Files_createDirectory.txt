This "test_Files_createDirectory" method is used to create a directory in the external storage of an Android device. Note that this requires the WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE permission, and you should make sure to have this permission requested and granted in your Android app before using this method. Additionally, as of API level 29, apps are not allowed to have unrestricted access to external storage, so you may need to use the Scoped Storage model if your app targets API level 29 or higher.
