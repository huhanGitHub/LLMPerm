The following is an example of a method testing the Android's "RestrictionsManager". RestrictionsManager is part of Android's enterprise features and can be used to manage the restrictions and capabilities for the users of a device.

In this method, we are requesting a permission from the RestrictionsManager. 

```java
import android.content.RestrictionsManager;
import android.os.Bundle;

public void test_RestrictionsManager_requestPermission() {
    
    //First we need to get the instance of RestrictionsManager
    RestrictionsManager restrictionsManager = (RestrictionsManager) getSystemService(Context.RESTRICTIONS_SERVICE);
    
    //Now we create a bundle which will have the requested permissions
    Bundle requestedPermission = new Bundle();
    requestedPermission.putString(RestrictionsManager.KEY_PACKAGE_NAME, getPackageName());
    requestedPermission.putStringArray(RestrictionsManager.KEY_REQUESTED_PERMISSIONS, new String[]{"android.permission.CAMERA"});
    
    //Finally we call requestPermission on RestrictionsManager instance with the bundle
    
    //Here it is important to note that REQUEST_LOCAL_APPROVAL is a local approval code. Replace it with a code that fits your purpose.
    restrictionsManager.requestPermission(requestedPermission, REQUEST_LOCAL_APPROVAL);
}
```

Please replace `"android.permission.CAMERA"` with the permission you want to request and `REQUEST_LOCAL_APPROVAL` with the relevant approval code that suits the specific request.
