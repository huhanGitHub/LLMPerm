The FileSystemProvider class of java.nio.file.spi package is an abstract class that renders service for file systems. However, the `createSymbolicLink()` method is present in `java.nio.file.Files` API, not in the FileSystemProvider.

Here is the mock implementation of `test_FileSystemProvider_createSymbolicLink` method using `createSymbolicLink()` method of `Files`.

```Java
import java.io.IOException;
import java.nio.file.Files;
import java.nio.file.Path;
import java.nio.file.Paths;

public void test_FileSystemProvider_createSymbolicLink() {
    // define a path where the symbolic link will be created
    Path symLinkPath = Paths.get("/path/to/symbolicLink");

    // define a path to an existing file or directory the symbolic link will point to
    Path targetPath = Paths.get("/path/to/existingFile");

    try {
        // delete the link if already exists, for testing purposes
        Files.deleteIfExists(symLinkPath);

        // create the symbolic link
        Files.createSymbolicLink(symLinkPath, targetPath);

        System.out.println("Symbolic link created successfully");
    } catch (UnsupportedOperationException ex) {
        System.err.println("The OS does not support symbolic links.");
    } catch (IOException ex) {
        System.err.println("I/O error occurred");
    }
}
```
Typically, the above example creates a symbolic link "symbolicLink" to an existing file "existingFile". When your code tries to access "symbolicLink", it will be automatically redirected to "existingFile".

Please make sure the path is correct according to your directory setup or file system. Remember that symbolic links are not fully supported by all file systems, and require special permissions to be created, so you may encounter a `UnsupportedOperationException` or a `SecurityException`.

Take into account that this method works in Java applications. Android does not have full support for Java's File I/O, and it has its own way of handling files and directories.
