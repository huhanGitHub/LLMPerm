Here's a simple implementation of the test_InetAddress_getAllByNameOnNet method which uses java.net.InetAddress.getAllByName() method:

```java
public void test_InetAddress_getAllByNameOnNet() {
    try {
        //Here,"www.google.com" is the host you want to get all the InetAddresses.
        InetAddress[] inetAddresses = InetAddress.getAllByName("www.google.com");

        for(InetAddress inetAddress : inetAddresses) {
            Log.d("InetAddress_Test", "HostAddress: " + inetAddress.getHostAddress());
        }
    } catch (UnknownHostException e) {
        e.printStackTrace();
    }
}
```
In this method, InetAddress.getAllByName() is used to get an array of InetAddress objects for a specified host. The host is represented by a string in this case "www.google.com". The method catches and prints any UnknownHostException. Note that this method must be run in a thread different from the main one to avoid NetworkOnMainThreadException.

Please remember that you will need to add the Internet permission in your AndroidManifest.xml file to allow your application to access the internet.

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />
```
