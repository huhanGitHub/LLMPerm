Here's an example of how you might use DriverManager.setLogWriter. However, please note that DriverManager is not suitable for use in Android, as Android uses its own database libraries, not JDBC.

```java
import java.io.PrintWriter;
import java.sql.DriverManager;
import java.sql.SQLException;

public void test_DriverManager_setLogWriter() {
    try {
        PrintWriter pw = new PrintWriter("your-log-file-here.txt");
        DriverManager.setLogWriter(pw);

        // make some database operations for which the logs will be written in the defined file...

    } catch (SQLException ex) {
        System.out.println("SQLException: " + ex.getMessage());
        System.out.println("SQLState: " + ex.getSQLState());
        System.out.println("VendorError: " + ex.getErrorCode());
    }
}
```

In this code, we first create a `PrintWriter` that writes to a file `your-log-file-here.txt`, and then we use `DriverManager.setLogWriter(pw)` to set the PrintWriter. after using `setLogWriter()`, all diagnostic information which is usually conducted to `System.err` is re-routed to the file specified by you instead.

Please replace `your-log-file-here.txt` with your own log file's path.

If anything goes wrong in setting the `LogWriter`, a `SQLException` will be thrown and you can use methods from `SQLException` class to retrieve more information from the exception.
