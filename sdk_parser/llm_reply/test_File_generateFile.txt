Sure, here is a method that serves as an example of using java.io.File to generate a file in an Android project. Please note that this method must run on a background thread or Async task since it is performing disk IO.

```java
public void test_File_generateFile(Context context) {
  try {
      // Create a File object for a new file in the application's files directory
      File file = new File(context.getFilesDir(), "exampleFile.txt");

      // If file does not exist, a new file is created
      if (!file.exists()) {
          file.createNewFile();
      }

      // String that will be written into the file
      String content = "This is an example file generated using java.io.File";

      // FileWriter is used to write the string into the file
      FileWriter fileWriter = new FileWriter(file);

      // Writing the string to the file
      fileWriter.write(content);

      // Closing the FileWriter
      fileWriter.close();

      Toast.makeText(context, "File created successfully", Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show();
  } catch (IOException e) {
      e.printStackTrace();
      Toast.makeText(context, "Error in file creation", Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show();
  }
}
```

This program is straightforward: it uses java.io.File to create a new file inside the app's file directory (the result of context.getFilesDir()). If the file does not exist, it creates a new one. It then writes a string into this file using a java.io.FileWriter. 

Important: Use this method in an Async task or a separate thread. Android doesn't allow disk IO operations (like file creation) on the main thread. If this code is run on the main thread, it will throw NetworkOnMainThreadException, which will crash your app. In Android, you must perform network operations on a thread other than the main UI thread.
