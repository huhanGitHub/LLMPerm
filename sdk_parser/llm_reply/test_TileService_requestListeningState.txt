        Log.i("TileServiceTest", "Listening state requested successfully");
    } catch (NoSuchMethodException ne) {
        Log.e("TileServiceTest", "Failed to invoke requestListeningState - method not found", ne);

        Log.e("TileServiceTest", "Failed to invoke requestListeningState - error thrown", ite);

Please note that there is a depending situation. Normally, you would have to override the `onStartListening()`, `onStopListening()`, and `onClick()` methods in your `TileService` implementation class, because they are the key moments when tiles get updated and interacted with.

In a `TileService` instance, you usually can't call `requestListeningState` directly because it's a static method that expects a `Context` and a `ComponentName` as its parameters. This test method uses reflection to call this method, passing a hypothetical `MainActivity` from package `com.example` as its `ComponentName`. 

You can change these values to the correct package and component name according to your application's package and the class where this code is being written.
