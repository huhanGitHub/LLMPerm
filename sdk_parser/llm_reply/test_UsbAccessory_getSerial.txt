Sure, here is an example method that tests the `getSerial` method of a `UsbAccessory`. First, it gets the `UsbManager` from the system services. Then it gets the list of connected USB accessories. For each connected accessory, it checks the serial number.

```java
public void test_UsbAccessory_getSerial() {
    // Get the UsbManager from Android.
    UsbManager usbManager = (UsbManager) getSystemService(Context.USB_SERVICE);

    // Get the list of connected UsbAccessories.
    UsbAccessory[] accessoryList = usbManager.getAccessoryList();

    // If there are any accessories connected.
    if(accessoryList != null) {
        for(UsbAccessory accessory : accessoryList) {
            // Get and print the accessory's serial number.
            String serial = accessory.getSerial();
            Log.i("USB_ACCESSORY_SERIAL", "Accessory's serial: " + serial);
        }
    } else {
        Log.i("USB_ACCESSORY_SERIAL", "No USB accessories found.");
    }
}
```

Please note that you have to specify `<uses-feature android:name="android.hardware.usb.accessory"/>` in your `AndroidManifest.xml` and also need appropriate permissions to access the USB accessory. This might also need to handle whether user has granted permission or not for the USB accessory connection.

You might need to handle null cases as well as sometimes `getSerial()` can return null if the accessory does not have a serial number, or if the accessory is not open for communication. This is a simple demonstration, you will need to add exception handling and other necessary business logic as per your need.
