Sure, here's a sample method which you can use as a reference to test adding of search URL in browser:

```java
@RequiresApi(api = Build.VERSION_CODES.JELLY_BEAN_MR2)
public void test_Browser_addSearchUrl() {
    // Check if the WRITE_HISTORY_BOOKMARKS permission is already available.
    if (checkSelfPermission(Manifest.permission.WRITE_HISTORY_BOOKMARKS)
            != PackageManager.PERMISSION_GRANTED) {
        // If not, then request permission
        requestPermissions(new String[]{Manifest.permission.WRITE_HISTORY_BOOKMARKS}, 0);
    } else {
        // If permission is already granted, then add a search URL in browser history
        try {
            String url = "https://www.example.com";
            String title = "Example Website";
            // Creating a values object to store the URL details
            ContentValues values = new ContentValues();
            values.put(Browser.BookmarkColumns.TITLE, title);
            values.put(Browser.BookmarkColumns.URL, url);
            values.put(Browser.BookmarkColumns.DATE, System.currentTimeMillis());
            // 0 = history, 1 = bookmark
            values.put(Browser.BookmarkColumns.BOOKMARK, 0);
            // Updating the browser history
            getContentResolver().insert(Browser.BOOKMARKS_URI, values);
            Log.d("Browser", "Search URL added successfully.");
        } catch (Exception e) {
            Log.e("Browser", "Error adding search URL.", e);
        }
    }
}
```

Please note that `android.provider.Browser.java` is deprecated as of API 23: Android 6.0 (Marshmallow) and no longer exists as of API 26: Android 8.0 (Oreo). You are supposed to use `WebView` instead to add and retrieve browsing history. The usage of the API above is for the lower versions. 

Before trying to do anything, be sure to check if your app has the `WRITE_HISTORY_BOOKMARKS` permission. If not, you need to request this from the user. After that, you can add the new search URL to the browser history. Since `Browser.BOOKMARKS_URI` is deprecated, use `Browser.BOOKMARKS_URI` instead, where this constant was re-introduced in API 23+ as a read-only that lists both bookmarks and visited site history (but does not differentiate between the two). 

Please adapt it according to your need.
