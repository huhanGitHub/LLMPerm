In this example, the user tries to delete a file. If the app doesn't have enough permissions, it will throw a RecoverableSecurityException which we can then show as a notification to the user asking for the required permissions.

First, make sure to declare the permission in your AndroidManifest.xml file:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE" />
```
Then, use the showAsNotification() method from RecoverableSecurityException to display a notification.

```java
public void test_RecoverableSecurityException_showAsNotification() {
    try {
        // Attempt to delete the file
        File file = new File("file_path");
        if (file.exists()) {
            file.delete();
        }
    } catch (SecurityException e) {
        // This would throw a RecoverableSecurityException if the app does not have enough permissions
        if (Build.VERSION.SDK_INT >= Build.VERSION_CODES.Q &&
                e instanceof RecoverableSecurityException) {
            IntentSender intentSender = ((RecoverableSecurityException) e).getUserAction().getActionIntent().getIntentSender();
            
            // If your app is in the background, you can show a notification that sends the above Intent when tapped
            NotificationCompat.Builder builder = new NotificationCompat.Builder(this, CHANNEL_ID)
                    .setSmallIcon(R.drawable.notification_icon)
                    .setContentTitle("My notification")
                    .setContentText("Hello World!")
                    .setPriority(NotificationCompat.PRIORITY_DEFAULT)
                    .setContentIntent(PendingIntent.getIntentSender(intentSender))
                    .setAutoCancel(true);  // The notification is automatically canceled when the user taps it
                            
            // Show the notification
            NotificationManagerCompat notificationManager = NotificationManagerCompat.from(this);
            notificationManager.notify(notificationId, builder.build());
        } else {
            // Handle other SecurityException cases
        }
    }
}
```
You can replace "file_path" with the actual path to the file you want to delete. The CHANNEL_ID and notificationId are unique identifiers for your notification; you should define these somewhere in your code. The R.drawable.notification_icon should be replaced with your custom notification icon.
