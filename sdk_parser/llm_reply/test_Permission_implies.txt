Here's a simple self-contained method `test_Permission_implies`. It takes two `Permission` objects, a target and an incoming permission, and uses the `implies(Permission)` method to test if the target permission implies the incoming one. If it does, it simply logs a message indicating this. If it doesn't imply, it throws a `SecurityException`. Please note that this is a hint, more complex scenarios like Access Control Contexts, Permission Collections will need to be handled accordingly.

This is suitable to use in Java standalone applications and may behave differently in the context of an Android application due to their security conscious design.
```java
import java.security.Permission;

public void test_Permission_implies() {
    // define a target permission - allow to read a file
    Permission targetPermission = new java.io.FilePermission("path/to/file", "read");
    
    // define an incoming permission - allow to read the same file
    Permission incomingPermission = new java.io.FilePermission("path/to/file", "read");
    
    // apply the implies() method
    if (targetPermission.implies(incomingPermission)) {
        System.out.println("Target permission implies the incoming permission.");
    } else {
        throw new SecurityException("Insufficient permissions.");
    }
}
```
Please update `"path/to/file"` strings with actual path to your files.

Remember: In actual applications it would be better to handle (try/catch) instead of throwing `SecurityException`. It can result in application termination if unhandled. Furthermore, the use of `System.out.println` is not recommended on Android. You should use `Log.d` or similar methods instead.
