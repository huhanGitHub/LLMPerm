Here is an example method `test_File_canWrite` that uses the `java.io.File` Android/JAVA API to check if you have write permission on a file in an Android environment:

```java
public boolean test_File_canWrite(String filePath) {
    // Creating a File instance
    File file = new File(filePath);
    // Checking the write permission
    boolean canWrite = file.canWrite();

    if (canWrite) {
        // Log or handle the case where you have the write permission
        Log.d("FilePermission", "You have write permission for this file.");
    } else {
        // Log or handle the case where you don't have the write permission
        Log.d("FilePermission", "You don't have write permission for this file.");
    }
    
    return canWrite;
}
```
In the method above, a `FilePath` string is passed as an argument. This string should contain the path to the file you want to check the write permissions for. The path depends on the location of the file in your device storage.

In an Android context, be aware of required permissions. If the file is on the external storage, you need the `WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` permission. If your app targets Android 6.0 (API level 23) and higher, you need to request this permission at runtime. If the file is in an app-specific directory on the external storage, you don't need any permissions.
