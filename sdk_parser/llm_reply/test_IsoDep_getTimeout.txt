Here's a basic implementation of the test_IsoDep_getTimeout method. This method is a part of an Android activity and shows how to use the getTimeout method from the IsoDep class in the Android NFC tech API.

```java
import android.nfc.Tag;
import android.nfc.tech.IsoDep;

public void test_IsoDep_getTimeout() {
    Tag tag = getIntent().getParcelableExtra(NfcAdapter.EXTRA_TAG);
    if (tag != null) {
        IsoDep isoDep = IsoDep.get(tag);
        if (isoDep != null) {
            try {
                isoDep.connect();
                int timeout = isoDep.getTimeout();
                //Here you can use timeout variable to do whatever you want with it.
                Log.d("IsoDep Timeout", "Timeout: " + timeout);
                isoDep.close();
            } catch (IOException e) {
                Log.e("IsoDep Error", e.getMessage());
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Please make sure your Android app has necessary permissions to use NFC (Near Field Communication). This code also assumes you are calling it from an Activity that has an NFC Intent filter defined and will get an NFC tag from an incoming Intent. Also, don't forget to add exception handling as you find fit. The connect and close methods can throw an IOException which we are catching and logging it.
