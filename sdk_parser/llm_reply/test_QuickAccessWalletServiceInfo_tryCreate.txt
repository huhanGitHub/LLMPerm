In this example, I am assuming that you are creating an Android app which treats your device like a Google Pay wallet.

Please note that QuickAccessWalletServiceInfo API is related to the NFC payment methods. This API is used to show relevant card information at the bottom of the screen when a device is tapped on a payment terminal.

```java
public class MainActivity extends AppCompatActivity {

    @Override
    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);

        try {
            test_QuickAccessWalletServiceInfo_tryCreate();
        } catch (PackageManager.NameNotFoundException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }

    public void test_QuickAccessWalletServiceInfo_tryCreate() throws PackageManager.NameNotFoundException {
        PackageManager packageManager = getPackageManager();
		
        // Define the specific service you're interested in
        String service = "com.example.MyWalletService";  // Replace with actual service name
		
        // Get info for that service
        ServiceInfo si = packageManager.getServiceInfo(new ComponentName(getPackageName(), service), PackageManager.GET_SERVICES);
		
        // Create a QuickAccessWalletServiceInfo using ServiceInfo
        QuickAccessWalletServiceInfo quickAccessWalletServiceInfo = QuickAccessWalletServiceInfo.tryCreate(si);
		
        if (quickAccessWalletServiceInfo != null) {
            // Now you can get information related to the service
            String label = quickAccessWalletServiceInfo.loadLabel(packageManager).toString(); 
            Log.d("WalletServiceInfo", "Label: "+label);
            // Similarly, you can get other information like Settings Activity Name, etc.
        } else {
            Log.d("WalletServiceInfo", "Unable to retrieve QuickAccessWalletServiceInfo.");
        }
    }

}
```

Remember to replace `com.example.MyWalletService` with the absolute name of your WalletService.

In addition, make sure that you add necessary QuickAccessWalletService in you AndroidManifest.xml and perform necessary implementations as this code will only work in that case.

This example is for development only and is not very useful in a real-world app. You must implement `QuickAccessWalletService` in a meaningful way based on your app's use cases.
