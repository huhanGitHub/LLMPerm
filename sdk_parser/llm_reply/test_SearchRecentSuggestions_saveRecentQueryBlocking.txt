Below is an example of a method called `test_SearchRecentSuggestions_saveRecentQueryBlocking` which uses the `SearchRecentSuggestions` class from Android's `android.provider` package. This method saves a query string to the recent searches of your application.

Assuming your `SearchRecentSuggestionsProvider` is setup correctly, the method will save a Query to your suggestions provider.

```javascript
public void test_SearchRecentSuggestions_saveRecentQueryBlocking() {
    // Authority of your SearchRecentSuggestionsProvider.
    String AUTHORITY = "<Your_SearchRecentSuggestionsProvider_Authority>";
    // Mode for your SearchRecentSuggestions.
    int MODE = SearchRecentSuggestions.QUERY_HISTORY_DATABASE;

    // Instance of the SearchRecentSuggestions
    SearchRecentSuggestions suggestions = new SearchRecentSuggestions(this, AUTHORITY, MODE);

    // Your Search Query that we are going to save to Recent Suggestions.
    String query = "Your Search Query";

    // Save your Query to the recent searches.
    suggestions.saveRecentQuery(query, null);
}
```
Please replace `<Your_SearchRecentSuggestionsProvider_Authority>` with the authority of your `SearchRecentSuggestionsProvider`.

This method does not return a result because `saveRecentQuery` method in SearchRecentSuggestions class does not return anything. It only saves the provided query to database.

IMPORTANT: This method should be executed on a background thread because `saveRecentQuery` performs disk IO operations and it can block the main/UI thread. Here, for simplicity, I have put it in the main thread. However, it's recommended to use either `AsyncTask`, a separate `Thread`, or other concurrent solution for this task.
