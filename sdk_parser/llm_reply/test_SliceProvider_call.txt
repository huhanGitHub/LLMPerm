Below is an example of how a `test_SliceProvider_call` could be implemented in an Android Activity. In this example, I have not yet provided an exact implementation because `SliceProvider` is an abstract class in Android that you must implement to handle sliceable content in your app.

Generally, `SliceProvider` is used in conjunction with Assistant and Search to show app content in different places. For this naturally, you will have to implement `SliceProvider` and create a `Slice` in it, which is not exactly callable in your Activity. Instead, your Activity needs to handle Intent which corresponds to URI you've set for your `Slice`.

```
import android.app.slice.Slice;
import android.app.slice.SliceProvider;
import android.content.ContentResolver;
import android.content.Intent;
import android.net.Uri;
import android.os.Bundle;
import androidx.appcompat.app.AppCompatActivity;

public class YourActivity extends AppCompatActivity {

    private static final String YOUR_SLICE_PROVIDER_AUTHORITY = "com.your.package.YourSliceProvider";
    private static final String YOUR_SLICE_PATH = "path_to_your_slice";

    @Override
    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);

        try {
            this.test_SliceProvider_call();
        } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }

    public void test_SliceProvider_call() throws Exception {
        ContentResolver resolver = getContentResolver();
        Uri sliceUri = new Uri.Builder()
                .scheme(ContentResolver.SCHEME_CONTENT)
                .authority(YOUR_SLICE_PROVIDER_AUTHORITY)
                .appendPath(YOUR_SLICE_PATH)
                .build();

        Slice slice = resolver.acquireSlice(sliceUri);
        // Now you can use your 'slice' object to interact with sliceable content
        // However, remember that actual implementation of Slice is done in SliceProvider
    }
}
```

This is a simplified scenario and actual implementation may significantly differ based on how you've implemented your `SliceProvider` and also on format and content of slices it provides.

Remember to turn off SliceProvider's autoGrantUriPermissions to false and grant permissions manually.
Please update `YOUR_SLICE_PROVIDER_AUTHORITY` and `YOUR_SLICE_PATH` with values specific to your app. This code should be placed in Activity you want to test `SliceProvider` from.
