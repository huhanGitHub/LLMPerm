Here is a self-contained method `test_SipManager_register`:

This method demonstrates an example usage of the Android SipManager API. It includes all necessary setup and cleanup steps to register and unregister a SIP profile.

Please note that this code requires the `android.permission.USE_SIP` and `android.permission.INTERNET` permissions.

```java
public void test_SipManager_register() {
    SipManager sipManager = null;
    SipProfile sipProfile = null;

    try {
        // Check if SIP VoIP is supported on this device.
        if(SipManager.isVoipSupported(this) && SipManager.isApiSupported(this)) {

            sipManager = SipManager.newInstance(this);

            SipProfile.Builder builder = new SipProfile.Builder("username", "domain");
            builder.setPassword("password");
            sipProfile = builder.build();

            // Register the profile.
            sipManager.open(sipProfile);
        }
    } catch (SipException e) {
        // Handle exception e.g., SIP is not supported or internet permission not granted.
        e.printStackTrace();
    } finally {
        // Don't forget to close the SipProfile and SipManager to release resources. 
        if (sipProfile != null) {
            try {
                sipManager.close(sipProfile.getUriString());
            } catch (SipException e) {
                e.printStackTrace();
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Remember that this is a simplified usage example and it doesn't include things like input validation and handling other potential exceptions. Additionally, the SIP account username, domain, and password are hardcoded here for simplicity. In a real use case you should retrieve them from appropriate sources or user input.

Also, the method `SipManager.open(SipProfile)` used here only opens a local profile that can be used for outgoing calls. To also receive incoming calls, you need to use the method `SipManager.open(SipProfile, PendingIntent, SipRegistrationListener)`.
