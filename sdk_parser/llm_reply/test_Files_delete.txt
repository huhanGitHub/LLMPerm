Since Android does not fully support java.nio.file.Files and its functionalities until API 26, this example uses standard Java: 

```java
import java.io.IOException;
import java.nio.file.*;

public static void test_Files_delete() {
    // Define the path of the file to delete
    Path path = Paths.get("path/to/file.txt");
    
    try {
        // Delete the file
        Files.delete(path);
        System.out.println("File was successfully deleted.");
    } catch (NoSuchFileException x) {
        System.err.format("%s: no such" + " file or directory%n", path);
    } catch (DirectoryNotEmptyException x) {
        System.err.format("%s not empty%n", path);
    } catch (IOException x) {
        // File permission problems are caught here.
        System.err.println(x);
    }
}
```

Replace `"path/to/file.txt"` with the actual path to the file you want to delete. This function will delete the file if it exists and is not a directory. If the file does not exist, a NoSuchFileException will be thrown. If the file is a directory and is not empty, a DirectoryNotEmptyException will be thrown. If there are any file permission problems, they will be caught and the details will be printed out.

Note: This method does not work on Android API lower than 26. In Android, it is recommended to use the official android APIs to manipulate files as there may be compatibility and safety issues with java.nio.file.Files.
