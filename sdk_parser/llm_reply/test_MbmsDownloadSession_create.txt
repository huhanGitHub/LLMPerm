Here is a method named test_MbmsDownloadSession_create that shows an example of how you could use the MbmsDownloadSession class in an Android activity. This involves creating an instance of MbmsDownloadSession to establish a download session.

```java
import android.content.Context;
import android.telephony.MbmsDownloadSession;
import android.telephony.mbms.MbmsDownloadSessionCallback;

public void test_MbmsDownloadSession_create() {
    Context context = this; // 'this' refers to an instance of an Android Context class (typically an Activity)
    MbmsDownloadSessionCallback sessionCallback = new MbmsDownloadSessionCallback() {
        @Override
        public void onError(int errorCode, String message) {
            super.onError(errorCode, message);
            // handle the error here, based on the error codes defined in MbmsErrors class
        }
        // Define other callback methods here per your requirement
    };

    try {
        MbmsDownloadSession session = MbmsDownloadSession.create(context, sessionCallback);
        // Now you can use 'session' object to download files using MBMS
    } catch (IllegalArgumentException | IllegalStateException e) {
        // Handle exception here 
    }
}
```

In this example, we are first creating a Context object which is a reference to the calling activity. Next, an instance of MbmsDownloadSessionCallback is created which includes the methods that will be called in response to various events related to the download session.

Then, we create a download session through MbmsDownloadSession's create method by passing the Context object and MbmsDownloadSessionCallback instance. 

In a real-world scenario, you will also need to handle potential exceptions and errors while creating a download session. The callback methods in MbmsDownloadSessionCallback would allow you to set the necessary actions, such as resolving errors or updating the UI.
