Here is an example of a method test_GeolocationPermissions_clear:

```java
public void test_GeolocationPermissions_clear() {
    WebView webView = new WebView(this);
    webView.getSettings().setJavaScriptEnabled(true);
    webView.getSettings().setGeolocationEnabled(true);

    webView.setWebChromeClient(new WebChromeClient() {
        @Override
        public void onGeolocationPermissionsShowPrompt(String origin, GeolocationPermissions.Callback callback) {
            // Allow geolocation access
            callback.invoke(origin, true, false);
        }
    });

    webView.loadUrl("https://example.com");

    // Wait for the geolocation prompt to be shown and processed
    try {
        Thread.sleep(5000);
    } catch (InterruptedException e) {
        e.printStackTrace();
    }

    GeolocationPermissions.getInstance().clear("https://example.com");

    // Check if the permission has been effectively cleared
    GeolocationPermissions.getInstance().allow("https://example.com", new GeolocationPermissions.Callback() {
        @Override
        public void invoke(String origin, boolean allow, boolean retain) {
            if (allow) {
                throw new AssertionError("Permission was not cleared");
            }
        }
    });
}
```

This method first sets up a WebView, enables JavaScript and geolocation, and provides a WebChromeClient which allows geolocation access. It then tries to load an example URL.

After giving the WebView some time to process, it tries to clear the geolocation permission for the given URL using GeolocationPermission's clear method.

Finally, it checks if the permission has indeed been cleared by calling allow and checking if the provided callback is invoked with `allow` set to false. If `allow` is true, the method throws an AssertionError indicating that the permission was not cleared.

This method does not guarantee that the test will always pass, as it heavily depends on the behaviour of the WebView and the specifics of the website loaded. In a real-world scenario, you would likely want to use a more robust testing framework and perhaps mock out some of the dependencies for more reliable results.
