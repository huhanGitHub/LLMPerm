Sure, here is an example of a method that opens a MIDI device using the Android `MidiManager`:

```java
public void test_MidiManager_openDevice() {
    // Acquiring MidiManager instance
    MidiManager midiManager = (MidiManager) getSystemService(Context.MIDI_SERVICE);

    // Retrieve list of connected devices
    MidiDeviceInfo[] midiDevices = midiManager.getDevices();
    if (midiDevices.length == 0) {
        // Display a message if no devices found
        Log.d("No MIDI Devices", "No MIDI devices could be retrieved");
        return;
    }

    // Get the first MIDI device information object
    MidiDeviceInfo firstDevice = midiDevices[0];
    
    // Attempt to open the first MIDI device
    midiManager.openDevice(firstDevice, new MidiManager.OnDeviceOpenedListener() {
        @Override
        public void onDeviceOpened(MidiDevice midiDevice) {
            if (midiDevice == null) {
                // If the device could not be opened properly
                Log.d("MIDI Device Error", "Could not open MIDI device");
            } else {
                // If the device was opened, you can now send and receive MIDI data
                Log.d("MIDI Device Success", "MIDI device opened successfully!");
            }
        }
    }, new Handler(Looper.getMainLooper()));
}
```

This method will open the first MIDI Device that it finds connected to the device. It assumes that this method is placed within an android activity, so it can directly call the `getSystemService()` method.

Also, be mindful that to make MIDI APIs work properly and detect the connected devices, you need to declare the appropriate permissions in your `Manifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-feature android:name="android.software.midi" android:required="true" />
```
 
Remember: Modern Android versions (>= 6.0) require you to explicitly ask the user for permission to access the MIDI device. Check the Android Documentation on how to do that.
