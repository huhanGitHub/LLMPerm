Here's an example of how you could test the `setDeviceAddress` method within a `ScanFilter`:

```java
@RequiresApi(api = Build.VERSION_CODES.LOLLIPOP)
public void test_ScanFilter_setDeviceAddress() {
    try {
        // An example MAC address. This might come from a real device in your environment.
        final String testDeviceAddress = "00:11:22:33:44:55";

        // Create a ScanFilter builder.
        ScanFilter.Builder scanFilterBuilder = new ScanFilter.Builder();

        // Set the device address of scan filter.
        scanFilterBuilder.setDeviceAddress(testDeviceAddress);

        // Build the ScanFilter
        ScanFilter scanFilter = scanFilterBuilder.build();

        // Get the device address of ScanFilter.
        String deviceAddress = scanFilter.getDeviceAddress();

        // Check if the input MAC address matches the builder-set MAC address.
        if (!testDeviceAddress.equals(deviceAddress)) {
            throw new Exception("ScanFilter setDeviceAddress failed: expected " + testDeviceAddress + " but got " + deviceAddress);
        }

        // Log the success message 
        Log.d("test_ScanFilter_setDeviceAddress", "ScanFilter setDeviceAddress passed.");
    } catch (Exception ex) {
        // Log the error message
        Log.e("test_ScanFilter_setDeviceAddress", "Error in test_ScanFilter_setDeviceAddress: " + ex.getMessage());
    }
}
```

This method intended to be used with an Android application and utilizes logging to indicate whether the test passed successfully. This test takes a mock-up device MAC address and set it to the `ScanFilter` through `ScanFilter.Builder`, then retrieves the address set through the method `getDeviceAddress` to verify if the device address was set correctly. If the addresses match, it's confirmed that the method `setDeviceAddress` has worked as expected. 

Please replace the example MAC address with a real one from your environment as required.
