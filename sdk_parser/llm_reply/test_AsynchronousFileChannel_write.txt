Below is the simple usage example of `AsynchronousFileChannel` in Java. For this particular testing method we will be writing some data to a text file asynchronously. 

Please note that `AsynchronousFileChannel` is not specifically related to Android and doesn't need any special permissions. It is a standard Java NIO API that works on all platforms supporting Java. 

```java
import java.nio.ByteBuffer;
import java.nio.channels.AsynchronousFileChannel;
import java.nio.file.Paths;
import java.nio.file.StandardOpenOption;
import java.util.concurrent.Future;

public void test_AsynchronousFileChannel_write() {
    try {
        AsynchronousFileChannel asynchronousFileChannel = AsynchronousFileChannel.open(
                Paths.get("sample.txt"), StandardOpenOption.WRITE);
        
        ByteBuffer buffer = ByteBuffer.allocate(1024);
        String data = "Testing AsynchronousFileChannel write operation";
        buffer.clear();
        buffer.put(data.getBytes());
        buffer.flip();

        // Start the write
        Future<Integer> operation = asynchronousFileChannel.write(buffer, 0);

        while(!operation.isDone()) {
            // Here we can do something while the write operation is being executed asynchronously
            System.out.println("Waiting for the write operation to complete...");
        }

        // Get the result of the operation (number of bytes written)
        int result = operation.get();
        System.out.println("Bytes written : " + result);

        asynchronousFileChannel.close();
    } catch (Exception e) {
        e.printStackTrace();
    }
}
```

This example asynchronously writes a string to a file named `sample.txt`. The `while` loop just checks if the write operation is still pending and when it finishes, it prints the number of bytes written. In a real application, you could replace this polling method with a `CompletionHandler` to get a callback when the operation is complete. 

Please ensure that the file `sample.txt` is located in the project directory or provide the absolute path to the file. Also remember that this code will replace any text already in the file. Change the `StandardOpenOption` to `APPEND` if you want to append text instead.
