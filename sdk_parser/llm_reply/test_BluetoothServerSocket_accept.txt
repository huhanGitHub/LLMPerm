Below is an example of a method that uses BluetoothServerSocket's accept method. Before running this code, make sure your app has the following permissions:

Bluetooth

Bluetooth Admin

Access Coarse Location (for Android 6.0 and above)

```java
import android.bluetooth.BluetoothAdapter;
import android.bluetooth.BluetoothServerSocket;
import android.bluetooth.BluetoothSocket;
import android.util.Log;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.util.UUID;

// Testing BluetoothServerSocket's accept method
public void test_BluetoothServerSocket_accept(){
    BluetoothAdapter mBluetoothAdapter = BluetoothAdapter.getDefaultAdapter();
    BluetoothServerSocket mBluetoothServerSocket = null;
    BluetoothSocket mBluetoothSocket = null;

    // Universal Well Known UUID for this application
    UUID MY_UUID = UUID.fromString("fa87c0d0-afac-11de-8a39-0800200c9a66");

    // Using the well known SPP UUID
    UUID SPP_UUID = UUID.fromString("00001101-0000-1000-8000-00805F9B34FB");

    try {
        // MY_UUID is the app's UUID string, also used by the client code
        mBluetoothServerSocket = mBluetoothAdapter.listenUsingRfcommWithServiceRecord("MyApp", MY_UUID);
    } catch (IOException e) {
        Log.e("SERVER_SOCKET", "Socket's listen() method failed", e);
    }

    try {
        // This is a blocking call and will only return on a
        // successful connection or an exception
        mBluetoothSocket = mBluetoothServerSocket.accept();
    } catch (IOException e) {
        Log.e("SERVER_SOCKET", "Socket's accept() method failed", e);
    }

    if (mBluetoothSocket != null) {
        // A connection was accepted. Perform work associated with
        // the connection in a separate thread
        manageMyConnectedSocket(mBluetoothSocket);

        try {
            mBluetoothServerSocket.close();
        } catch (IOException e) {
            Log.e("SERVER_SOCKET", "Could not close the connect socket", e);
        }
    }
}


// This method is used to do the actual data transfer process
private void manageMyConnectedSocket(BluetoothSocket mSocket) {
    // Do work to manage the connection (in a separate thread)
    // write code to send and receive data from your Bluetooth other device.
}
```

This code first creates a BluetoothServerSocket that listens for connection requests. When a request arrives, it accepts the connection, passing the BluetoothSocket returned from accept() to another method to manage the connection.

Replace 'MyApp' with your app name and use your own UUID.
