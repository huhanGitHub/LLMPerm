Assuming you have the necessary permissions to access the microphone and have added them in your Manifest file (RECORD_AUDIO), here is an example:

```java
public void test_AutomaticGainControl_create() {
    final int audioSessionId = 0; // Replace with the audio session ID you need.
    if (AutomaticGainControl.isAvailable()) {
        AutomaticGainControl agc = AutomaticGainControl.create(audioSessionId);
        if (agc != null) {
            boolean enabled = agc.getEnabled();
            int status = agc.setEnabled(!enabled); // toggle it
            if (status == AudioEffect.SUCCESS) {
                Log.d("AGC_Test", enabled ? "AGC disabled" : "AGC enabled");
            } else {
                Log.w("AGC_Test", "Failed to change AGC status");
            }
            agc.release(); // release after use
        } else {
            Log.e("AGC_Test", "Failed to create AutomaticGainControl");
        }
    } else {
        Log.w("AGC_Test", "AutomaticGainControl is not available on this device");
    }
}
```

This method creates an `AutomaticGainControl` for a given audio session id, and toggles its enabled state (enabling it if it's disabled, or disabling it if it's enabled).

Please note the audio session id should be obtained from an instance of `AudioRecord` or `MediaPlayer` which is currently used to process audio.

Please also note that `AutomaticGainControl` is part of the audio pre-processing effects, this means you need to have an audio input to adjust the gain, typically from the device's microphone, so you would need the `android.Manifest.permission.RECORD_AUDIO` permission.

It's also important to release the effect when you're finished using it, as the number of simultaneous instances can be limited by the device's capabilities.
