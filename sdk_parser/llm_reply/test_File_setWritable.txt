Below is a sample method `test_File_setWritable` which makes use of the `setWritable` method from the `java.io.File` class in Java. The method creates a new file and tries to set it as writable. It prints a success message if the operation was successful, otherwise it prints an error message. Note that it handles `IOException` which may occur when creating a new file. 

In Android, these operations should be done with the necessary permissions. To write on an external storage, you should request the `WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` permission in your `AndroidManifest.xml` file.

```Java
void test_File_setWritable() {
    //creating a new file
    File file = new File("/path/to/your/file.txt");
    try {
        if (file.createNewFile()) {
            // set the file to be writable
            boolean isWritable = file.setWritable(true);
            if(isWritable){
                System.out.println("File is set to be writable!");
            }else{
                System.out.println("Failed to set the file as writable!");
            }
        } else {
            System.out.println("File already exists!");
        }
    } catch (IOException e) {
        e.printStackTrace();
    }
}
```

Remember to replace `/path/to/your/file.txt` with the actual file path where you want to create the file. It could be in the internal or external storage, depending on your application needs.
