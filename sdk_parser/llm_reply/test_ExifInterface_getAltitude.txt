```java
import android.media.ExifInterface;
import java.io.IOException;

public void test_ExifInterface_getAltitude() {
    try {
        // Specify the path to the photo
        String photoPath = "/sdcard/DCIM/Camera/IMG_20210512_000123.jpg";
        ExifInterface exifInterface = new ExifInterface(photoPath);

        // Get altitude data from EXIF information
        double altitude = exifInterface.getAltitude(0);

        // Output the altitude to the console. In real world app, you can use it as per your requirement instead of logging it to console.
        Log.d("Altitude", "Altitude: " + altitude);
    } catch (IOException e) {
        e.printStackTrace();
    }
}
```
A few important notes:
1. Altitude is typically included only on photos taken from devices with a GPS chip, such as smartphones.
2. The ExifInterface constructor takes the full path to a photo file. Now it is hardcoded, in real world app, you would get it from camera or gallery.
3. In case the photo has no GPS altitude data, a default value (in this case, 0) will be used.
4. Make sure android app has required permissions to read the storage.
5. This code uses Log.d() for debugging; if errors arise, these messages will be output in Android Studio's logcat.
