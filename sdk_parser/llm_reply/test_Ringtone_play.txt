Below is the method `test_Ringtone_play` which uses Android's Ringtone class:

```java
import android.app.Activity;
import android.content.Context;
import android.database.Cursor;
import android.media.Ringtone;
import android.media.RingtoneManager;
import android.net.Uri;
import android.os.Bundle;

public class MainActivity extends Activity {

    @Override
    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);
        try {
            test_Ringtone_play();
        } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }

    public void test_Ringtone_play() {
        Uri notification = RingtoneManager.getDefaultUri(RingtoneManager.TYPE_NOTIFICATION);
        Ringtone r = RingtoneManager.getRingtone(getApplicationContext(), notification);
        r.play();
    }
}
```

In this code snippet, the `test_Ringtone_play` method is called within the `onCreate` method of an Activity. In the `test_Ringtone_play` method, `RingtoneManager.getDefaultUri(RingtoneManager.TYPE_NOTIFICATION)` is called to get the default notification sound of the device. Then, `RingtoneManager.getRingtone` is used to get a `Ringtone` object for the notification. Once we have this `Ringtone` object, we can call `r.play()` to actually play the sound.

This is a very basic usage of the `Ringtone` class and doesn't take into account any user preferences or settings. It just plays the default notification sound once. It's intended to provide a simple example and isn't necessarily representative of how you'd use this class in a real-world application.
