Here is an example of a method that uses OnReceiveContentListener in an Android activity:

```java
public void test_OnReceiveContentListener_onReceiveContent() {
    View view = findViewById(R.id.my_view);
        
    view.setOnReceiveContentListener(new View.OnReceiveContentListener() {
        @Override
        public ContentCaptureSession newSession(ContentCaptureContext contentCaptureContext) {
            return null;
        }

        @Override
        public void onContentReceived(@NonNull View view, @NonNull ContentInfo contentInfo) {

            int operation = contentInfo.getFlags();
            
            if (operation == ContentInfo.FLAG_CONVERT_TO_PLAIN_TEXT) {
                CharSequence text = contentInfo.getClip().getItemAt(0).getText();
                Log.d("ContentListener", "Received text: " + text);
            }    
            
            contentInfo.releasePermission();
        }
    });
}
```

This method will set a view with given ID (in this case, `R.id.my_view`) to listen to content receiving events. When the view receives content with a type of `FLAG_CONVERT_TO_PLAIN_TEXT`, it will log the content. Like any other listener, don't forget to remove it when it's not needed anymore to avoid memory leaks.

Please note that the APIs I used are actually hypothetical. To my knowledge, there's no such method like `view.setOnReceiveContentListener(new View.OnReceiveContentListener() {...});` This demonstration is for illustrative purposes considering that the `OnReceiveContentListener()` is part of your application.
