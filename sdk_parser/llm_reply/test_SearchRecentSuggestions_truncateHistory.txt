Here's an example of how you can use the `SearchRecentSuggestions.truncateHistory` method in Android. This method is helpful for deleting all recent search suggestions.

First, you need to make sure the necessary permission is declared in your AndroidManifest.xml.

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_HISTORY_BOOKMARKS"/>
```

This example assumes you created a `SearchRecentSuggestions` instance which interacts with a content provider based on your authority and mode.

```java
import android.app.Activity;
import android.provider.SearchRecentSuggestions;

public class TestActivity extends Activity {

    private static final String AUTHORITY = "com.example.app.SearchSuggestionProvider";
    private static final int MODE = 0;

    // ...

    /**
     * A method to demonstrate the usage of SearchRecentSuggestions.truncateHistory.
     */
    public void test_SearchRecentSuggestions_truncateHistory() {
        // Create a new SearchRecentSuggestions instance.
        SearchRecentSuggestions suggestions = new SearchRecentSuggestions(this, 
                                                                         AUTHORITY, 
                                                                         MODE);

        // Call truncateHistory() method to clear all search history.
        suggestions.truncateHistory();
    }
}
```

You should replace `"com.example.app.SearchSuggestionProvider"` and `MODE` with your actual authority and the mode set while creating the search suggestions. Remember, this will clear ALL the recent search suggestions.

`truncateHistory()` may need to be called in a background thread as it has potential to block your UI thread due to the underlying `ContentResolver#delete` operation, which depends on your 'ContentProvider' implementation and how much data it needs to delete.
