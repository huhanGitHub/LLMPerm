Below is a method that demonstrates how to set the timeout using the `setTimeout` method of the `NfcF` class. This method is part of test scenarios, which are invoked during the development phase to make sure that the code is working as expected.

In this method, an `NfcF` object is created and its timeout is set to a specified period. 

Please adjust the `TIMEOUT` variable according to your requirements. The timeout is expressed in milliseconds.

```java
public void test_NfcF_setTimeout() {
    // Initialize a Tag object
    Tag tag = null;

    // Normally, tag object is acquired from an NFC discovery intent via getParcelableExtra(NfcAdapter.EXTRA_TAG)
    // Tag tag = intent.getParcelableExtra(NfcAdapter.EXTRA_TAG);
    
    try {
        // Retrieve NfcF instance for the Tag
        NfcF nfcF = NfcF.get(tag);
        if (nfcF != null) {
            // Connect to the tag first before any I/O operation
            nfcF.connect();

            // Set timeout
            final int TIMEOUT = 5000; // Set timeout to 5 seconds
            nfcF.setTimeout(TIMEOUT);

            // If no error occurred, the timeout setting is successful
            Log.i("NFC", "NfcF timeout set successfully to " + TIMEOUT + " milliseconds");
            
            // Always not forget to close the I/O connection when finish
            nfcF.close();

        } else {
            Log.i("NFC", "This tag does not support NfcF");
        }
    } catch (IOException e) {
        // Handle I/O exception
        Log.e("NFC", "Error while setting timeout", e);
    }
}
```

You must invoke this method in a context where a `Tag` object is available. Typically you get a `Tag` object from an NFC discovery intent in the `onNewIntent()` method of an `Activity` class. 

Note also that this test function logs the result of the timeout setting operation. You may want to replace logging with actual tests, such as assertions, depending on your unit testing framework. It also assumes that your AndroidManifest.xml has required NFC permissions.
