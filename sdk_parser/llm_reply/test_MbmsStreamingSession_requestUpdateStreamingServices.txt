Here is an example of a method that might work for you in your Android Activity. In the example below, it's assumed that you have the context and other details to create MbmsStreamingSession.

This Android API is used to interface with mobile broadcast services provided by the carrier, so you need to understand it requires the appropriate service.
```java
private void test_MbmsStreamingSession_requestUpdateStreamingServices() {
   ...
   // Assume the context and service class has been initialized
   Context context = this;
   Executor executor = Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor();
   String serviceClass = "";  // The service class, which should be given by carrier or service provider
   
   // Create the callback for streaming session
   MbmsStreamingSession.Callback callback = new MbmsStreamingSession.Callback() {
       @Override
       public void onError(int errorCode, String message) {
           // Handle the error accordingly
           Log.e("MbmsStreamingSession", "Error requesting streaming service update: " + errorCode + ", " + message);
       }
   };
   
   MbmsStreamingSession session = MbmsStreamingSession.create(context, executor, callback);
   
   // Request the update streaming services
   // This will trigger the carriers to push the updated streaming services to the device
   session.requestUpdateStreamingServices(serviceClass);
   
   // Please Call session.close() when you're finished to release resources 
   ...
}
```
Unfortunately, there is no way of running this code in unit test because it requires a system service action which can not be mocked (The system service usage is inside create method of MbmsStreamingSession - it directly calls to system service). 

Moreover, MbmsStreamingSession is available from API level 28. Therefore, the device running the code need to be in API level 28 and above.
