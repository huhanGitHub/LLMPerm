Here's an example of how you can use the VisualVoicemailService.getSubId() method.

```java
@RequiresApi(Build.VERSION_CODES.O)
public void test_VisualVoicemailService_getSubId() {
    // Create a new instance of VisualVoicemailService
    VisualVoicemailService visualVoicemailService = new VisualVoicemailService() {
        @Override
        public void onCreateVoicemailService() {

        }
    };

    // There is no way to directly access getSubId() without having a VisualVoicemailTask object
    // We simulate this by creating a mock VisualVoicemailTask instance
    VisualVoicemailTask visualVoicemailTask = Mockito.mock(VisualVoicemailTask.class);

    try {
        // Access a private method using Java Reflection API
        Method getSubIdMethod = VisualVoicemailService.class.getDeclaredMethod("getSubId",
                new Class[]{VisualVoicemailService.VisualVoicemailTask.class});

        // Change the accessibility of the method
        getSubIdMethod.setAccessible(true);

        // Invoke the method
        int subId = (int) getSubIdMethod.invoke(visualVoicemailService, visualVoicemailTask);

        // Print the returned subId
        Log.d("test_VisualVoicemailService_getSubId", "SubId: " + subId);

    } catch (NoSuchMethodException | IllegalAccessException | InvocationTargetException e) {
        e.printStackTrace();
    }
}
```

Make sure your Android device software version is Oreo (API level 26) or higher which is a minimum requirement for the getSubId() method. Also, Mockito library is used in this example which can be added to your gradle file as follows:

```groovy
dependencies {
    testImplementation 'org.mockito:mockito-core:3.2.4'
}
```

As per Android's documentation getSubId() is a protected method which is not directly accessible. Consequently, this code uses Java's Reflection API to make it accessible. However, using reflection is not recommended for production code as it can lead to unforeseen errors and can break your code on newer Android versions. The use of reflection is only for the purpose of demonstrating the use of the hidden Android API in this case. Please refactor this code or ask the manufacturer for APIs to fulfill your requirements in the production environment.
