Sure, I will provide you a method which represents the basic usage of java.net.DatagramSocket's receive method. Note that due to the networking nature of this function, actual usage may differ based on the specific networking circumstances of your application.

Here's the basic usage: 

```java
public void test_DatagramSocket_receive() {
    try {
        // Create a DatagramSocket
        DatagramSocket datagramSocket = new DatagramSocket(12345);

        // Create a DatagramPacket to receive data
        byte[] buffer = new byte[1024];
        DatagramPacket packet = new DatagramPacket(buffer, buffer.length);

        // Set a receive timeout, if you wish (in milliseconds)
        datagramSocket.setSoTimeout(5000);

        try {
            // Receive data into the DatagramPacket
            datagramSocket.receive(packet);

            // The data received. Note that the packet's length is now the actual length of the data
            byte[] dataReceived = Arrays.copyOf(packet.getData(), packet.getLength());

            // Processing or using the data received
            System.out.println("Data received: " + new String(dataReceived, StandardCharsets.UTF_8));

        } catch (SocketTimeoutException e) {
            // This exception will be thrown if a timeout was set and no packet was received within the timeout
            System.out.println("Time out, no response received.");
        }

        // Always close the DatagramSocket
        datagramSocket.close();
  
    } catch (IOException e) {
        // Handle any IO Exceptions
        e.printStackTrace();        
    }
}
```

This simple method attempts to receive a single packet of data from a DatagramSocket listening on port 12345, prints it out, and then closes the socket. If no data is received within the timeout, a message is printed instead.

Please remember to include the necessary network permissions in your AndroidManifest.xml if you are using this in an Android context.

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE" />
```

Please also note that in real-world applications, you should not do network operations on the main UI thread. In Android, you may use AsyncTask, Handler, or a separate Thread to perform network operations.
