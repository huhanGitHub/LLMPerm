Here is an example of how to test the `playDtmfTone` method in `RemoteConference` class.

First of all, you need permission is your manifest xml. 

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.MODIFY_PHONE_STATE" />
```

And then you could code like follow:

```java
public void test_RemoteConference_playDtmfTone() {
    String conferenceId = "myConferenceId"; // replace this with your conference id
    Char dtmfChar = '1'; // replace this with your dtmf tone

    // Create a telecom manager instance
    TelecomManager telecomManager = (TelecomManager) getSystemService(Context.TELECOM_SERVICE);
    
    if (telecomManager != null) {
        // Get the current conference
        RemoteConference conference = telecomManager.getConference(conferenceId);
        
        if (conference != null) {
            // Play the dtmf tone
            conference.playDtmfTone(dtmfChar);
            conference.stopDtmfTone();
        } else {
            Log.e("test", "Conference not found");
        }
    } else {
        Log.e("test", "Telecom manager not found");
    }
}
```

Note: This function will not work unless you have the `MODIFY_PHONE_STATE` permission declared in your app's manifest file with protection level being "signature|privileged". This means only system apps or apps signed with the system key can use this method, due to security reasons. This function will silently fail for third-party applications.
