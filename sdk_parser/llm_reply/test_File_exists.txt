Here is an example method you can use in your Android Activity to test if a file exists using the java.io.File API:

```java
import java.io.File;

public void test_File_exists() {
    // Specify a path to the file
    String filePath = "/path/to/your/file.txt";

    // Create a File object
    File file = new File(filePath);

    // Check if the file exists
    boolean fileExists = file.exists();

    // Print the result
    if (fileExists) {
        System.out.println("The file exists.");
    } else {
        System.out.println("The file does not exist.");
    }
}
```

This method will print out whether the specified file exists or not. Please change the 'filePath' variable with the real path of your file.

One important thing to note is that for Android, you'll likely want to work with files in context-specific directories provided by Android's APIs (such as those provided by Context.getExternalFilesDir(String)). Accessing files elsewhere requires permissions that users will need to grant when they install your app, and as of Android 10, access to the device's full filesystem is restricted. If you're testing the existence of a file in an app-specific directory, you can retrieve the directory with the appropriate method and construct your File object with that.

Also, remember to include the necessary permissions in AndroidManifest.xml file if you're trying to access external storage.
