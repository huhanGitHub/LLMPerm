Here is a simple and generic example of a method named "test_FileSystemProvider_delete". This method is used for deleting a file using the FileSystemProvider class in the Java API. Please replace file path and other variables with your own values to use in your application:

```java
import java.io.IOException;
import java.nio.file.FileSystem;
import java.nio.file.FileSystems;
import java.nio.file.Files;
import java.nio.file.Path;
import java.nio.file.spi.FileSystemProvider;


public void test_FileSystemProvider_delete() {
    
    // Get the default FileSystem
    FileSystem fs = FileSystems.getDefault();

    // Get the FileSystemProvider from the FileSystem
    FileSystemProvider provider = fs.provider();
    
    // Set the Path to the file to delete
    Path fileToDelete = fs.getPath("/path/to/your/file.txt");
    
    try {
        // Use the provider to delete the file
        provider.delete(fileToDelete);
        System.out.println("File deleted successfully");
    } catch (IOException e) {
        e.printStackTrace();
    }
}
```
Please be aware that operating on the file system in a mobile environment may require additional permissions to be specified, and on Android, user's explicit permission to access the file system. Please ensure that your application has the appropriate permissions to read or write to the location where you are performing the deletion operation. 

Also, error handling is a necessity when working with files. Ensure to handle possible exceptions and other error conditions. Here, IO exception is caught and stack trace is printed, but in a real-world scenario, more specific error handling would be necessary, including informing the user about the issue in a user-friendly way.
