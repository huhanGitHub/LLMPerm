Sure, the method you requested might look like this:

```java
import android.content.ContentResolver;
import android.content.Context;
import android.database.Cursor;
import android.media.tv.TvContract;
import android.net.Uri;
import android.util.Log;

public void test_TvContract_requestChannelBrowsable(Context context) {
    ContentResolver contentResolver = context.getContentResolver();
    Uri uri = TvContract.Channels.CONTENT_URI;
    String[] projection = {TvContract.Channels.COLUMN_BROWSABLE};
    String selection = null;
    String[] selectionArgs = null;
    String sortOrder = null; 

    Cursor cursor = null;
    try {
        cursor = contentResolver.query(uri, projection, selection, selectionArgs, sortOrder);
        if (cursor != null && cursor.moveToNext()) {
            int index = cursor.getColumnIndexOrThrow(TvContract.Channels.COLUMN_BROWSABLE);
            int isBrowsable = cursor.getInt(index);
            Log.d("TvContract", "Channel is browsable: " + (isBrowsable == 1));
        }
    } catch (Exception e) {
        Log.e("TvContract", "Failed to retrieve channel browsable status.", e);
    } finally {
        if (cursor != null) {
            cursor.close();
        }
    }
}
```
This method is a simple example of how to use Android's TvContract API, specifically the access and check of TV channel's browsable status. This sample code retrieves the TvContract.Channels.COLUMN_BROWSABLE field for each TV channel returned by the query.

The projection parameter lists the fields to return in the cursor, and I believe you want TvContract.Channels.COLUMN_BROWSABLE.

By convention, a browsable channel is one that can be accessed by the user, possibly amongst other channels, so this value could be vital if you want to filter TV channels (for example, hide those which aren't browsable).

In the try block, it queries these fields and logs if the channel is browsable. In the catch block, it logs any exceptions that occurred during the query process. In the finally block, it closes the cursor if it is still open, to free up resources.

Alternatively, you might want to improve this method further by turning it into a function that returns the browsable status of a channel. This might be more useful in a real-world usage scenario.
