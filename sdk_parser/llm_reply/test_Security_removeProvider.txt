Here is an example of a usage of the `Security.removeProvider` method in `java.security.Security`. This method is used to remove a security provider by its name. The provided name must match exactly with the name of the security provider that needs to be removed.

Please note that using this method to remove security providers is generally not recommended because it can potentially make your application vulnerable to security attacks.

```java
public void test_Security_removeProvider() {
    //The name of the security provider to remove
    String providerName = "BC"; //For example, Bouncy Castle provider

    if (Security.getProvider(providerName) != null) {
        //The removeProvider method returns void
        Security.removeProvider(providerName);
        System.out.println("Security provider removed.");
    } else {
        System.out.println("Provider not found. Unable to remove.");
    }
}
```
This self-contained method checks if a security provider with name `'BC'` exists. If it exists, the method removes it and prints `'Security provider removed.'`. If it doesn't exist, it prints `'Provider not found. Unable to remove.'`.

Remember to replace `'BC'` with the exact name of the security provider that you want to remove.
